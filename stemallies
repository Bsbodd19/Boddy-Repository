year

although
up
to
the
present
the
loss
of
life
has
been
merci
diminish

the
decis
reach
in
the
cours
of
the
struggl
are
even
more
profound
upon
the
fate
of
nation
than
anyth
that
has
ever
happen
sinc
barbar
time

move
are
made
upon
the
scientif
and
strateg
board

advantag
are
gain
by
mechan
mean

as
a
result
of
which
score
of
million
of
men
becom
incap
of
further
resist

or
judg
themselv
incap
of
further
resist

and
a
fear
game
of
chess
proceed
from
check
to
mate
by
which
the
unhappi
player
seem
to
be
inexor
bound


there
is
anoth
more
obvious
differ
from
1914

the
whole
of
the
war
nation
are
engag

not
onli
soldier

but
the
entir
popul

men

women
and
children

the
front
are
everywher

the
trench
are
dug
in
the
town
and
street

everi
villag
is
fortifi

everi
road
is
bar

the
front
line
run
through
the
factori

the
workmen
are
soldier
with
differ
weapon
but
the
same
courag

these
are
great
and
distinct
chang
from
what
mani
of
us
saw
in
the
struggl
of
a
quarter
of
a
centuri
ago

there
seem
to
be
everi
reason
to
believ
that
this
new
kind
of
war
is
well
suit
to
the
genius
and
the
resourc
of
the
british
nation
and
the
british
empire

and
that

onc
we
get
proper
equip
and
proper
start

a
war
of
this
kind
will
be
more
favor
to
us
than
the
somber
mass
slaughter
of
the
somm
and
passchendael

if
it
is
a
case
of
the
whole
nation
fight
and
suffer
togeth

that
ought
to
suit
us

becaus
we
are
the
most
unit
of
all
the
nation

becaus
we
enter
the
war
upon
the
nation
will
and
with
our
eye
open

and
becaus
we
have
been
nurtur
in
freedom
and
individu
respons
and
are
the
product

not
of
totalitarian
uniform

but
of
toler
and
varieti

if
all
these
qualiti
are
turn

as
they
are
be
turn

to
the
art
of
war

we
may
be
abl
to
show
the
enemi
quit
a
lot
of
thing
that
they
have
not
thought
of
yet

sinc
the
german
drove
the
jew
out
and
lower
their
technic
standard

our
scienc
is
definit
ahead
of
their

our
geograph
posit

the
command
of
the
sea

and
the
friendship
of
the
unite
state
enabl
us
to
draw
resourc
from
the
whole
world
and
to
manufactur
weapon
of
war
of
everi
kind

but
especi
of
the
superfin
kind

on
a
scale
hitherto
practic
onli
by
nazi
germani


hitler
is
now
sprawl
over
europ

our
offens
spring
are
be
slowli
compress

and
we
must
resolut
and
method
prepar
ourselv
for
the
campaign
of
1941
and
1942

two
or
three
year
are
not
a
long
time

even
in
our
short

precari
live

they
are
noth
in
the
histori
of
the
nation

and
when
we
are
do
the
finest
thing
in
the
world

and
have
the
honor
to
be
the
sole
champion
of
the
liberti
of
all
europ

we
must
not
grudg
these
year
or
weari
as
we
toil
and
struggl
through
them

it
doe
not
follow
that
our
energi
in
futur
year
will
be
exclus
confin
to
defend
ourselv
and
our
possess

mani
opportun
may
lie
open
to
amphibi
power

and
we
must
be
readi
to
take
advantag
of
them

one
of
the
way
to
bring
this
war
to
a
speedi
end
is
to
convinc
the
enemi

not
by
word

but
by
deed

that
we
have
both
the
will
and
the
mean

not
onli
to
go
on
indefinit

but
to
strike
heavi
and
unexpect
blow

the
road
to
victori
may
not
be
so
long
as
we
expect

but
we
have
no
right
to
count
upon
this

be
it
long
or
short

rough
or
smooth

we
mean
to
reach
our
journey
s
end


it
is
our
intent
to
maintain
and
enforc
a
strict
blockad

not
onli
of
germani

but
of
itali

franc

and
all
the
other
countri
that
have
fallen
into
the
german
power

i
read
in
the
paper
that
herr
hitler
has
also
proclaim
a
strict
blockad
of
the
british
island

no
one
can
complain
of
that

i
rememb
the
kaiser
do
it
in
the
last
war

what
inde
would
be
a
matter
of
general
complaint
would
be
if
we
were
to
prolong
the
agoni
of
all
europ
by
allow
food
to
come
in
to
nourish
the
nazi
and
aid
their
war
effort

or
to
allow
food
to
go
in
to
the
subjug
peopl

which
certain
would
be
pillag
off
them
by
their
nazi
conqueror


there
have
been
mani
propos

found
on
the
highest
motiv

that
food
should
be
allow
to
pass
the
blockad
for
the
relief
of
these
popul

i
regret
that
we
must
refus
these
request

the
nazi
declar
that
they
have
creat
a
new
unifi
economi
in
europ

they
have
repeat
state
that
they
possess
ampl
reserv
of
food
and
that
they
can
feed
their
captiv
peopl

in
a
german
broadcast
of
27th
june
it
was
said
that
while
mr

hoover

plan
for

belgium
and

the
german
forc
had
alreadi
taken
the
necessari

we
know
that
in
norway
when
the
german
troop
went
in

there
were
food
suppli
to
last
for
a
year

we
know
that
poland

though
not
a

usual
produc
suffici

for

moreov

the
other

in

if
all
this
food
is
not

now

it
can
onli
be
becaus
it
has
been
remov
to
feed
the
peopl
of

to
give
them
increas

for
a

dure
the
last

at
this

of

for

now
and
dure

if
the
german
use
these
commod
to
help
them
to
bomb
our
women
and
children

rather
than
to
feed
the
popul
who
produc
them

we
may
be
sure
that
import

would
go
the
same
way

direct
or
indirect

or
be

to
reliev
the

of

or
at

point
in

we

burn

that

today
not

feel

but
should

be

than

let

see
what
has

on

of

the
british

find

no

some

we

it
may
be
that
even
greater
ordeal
lie
befor

we
shall
face
whatev
is
come

we
are
sure
of
ourselv
and
of

and
that
is
the
suprem
fact
which
has
emerg
in
these
month
of
trial


meanwhil

we
have
not
onli
fortifi
our
heart
but
our
island

we
have
rearm
and
rebuilt
our
armi
in
a
degre
which
would
have
been
deem
imposs
a
few
month

we
have
ferri
across

in

all

without

of

the

work
as
they
have
never

befor

has
pour
forth
to

the
whole

is
at

more
than
2
000
000
determin
men
have
rifl
and
bayonet
in
their
hand
tonight

and
three
quarter
of
them
are
in
regular
militari
format

we
have
never
had
armi
like
this
in
our
island
in
time
of
war

the
whole
island
bristl
against
invad

from
the
sea
or
from
the
air

as
i
explain
to
the
hous
in
the
middl
of
june

the
stronger
our
armi
at
home

the
larger
must
the
invad
expedit
be

and
the
larger
the
invad
expedit

the
less
difficult
will
be
the
task
of
the
navi
in
detect
it
assembl
and
in
intercept
and
destroy
it
in
passag

and
the
greater
also
would
be
the
difficulti
of
feed
and
suppli
the
invad
if
ever
they
land

in
the
teeth
of
continu
naval
and
air
attack
on
their
communic

all
this
is
classic
and
vener
doctrin

as
in
nelson
s
day

the
maxim
hold


our
first
line
of
defens
is
the
enemi
s
port


now
air
reconnaiss
and
photographi
have
brought
to
an
old
principl
a
new
and
potent
aid


our
navi
is
far
stronger
than
it
was
at
the
begin
of
the
war

the
great
flow
of
new
construct
set
on
foot
at
the
outbreak
is
now
begin
to
come
in

we
hope
our
friend
across
the
ocean
will
send
us
a
time
reinforc
to
bridg
the
gap
between
the
peac
flotilla
of
1939
and
the
war
flotilla
of
1941

there
is
no
difficulti
in
send
such
aid

the
sea
and
ocean
are
open

the
u
boat
are
contain

the
magnet
mine
is

up
to
the
present
time

effect
master

the
merchant
tonnag
under
the
british
flag

after
a
year
of
unlimit
u
boat
war

after
eight
month
of
intens
mine
attack

is
larger
than
when
we
began

we
have

in
addit

under
our
control
at
least
4
000
000
ton
of
ship
from
the
captiv
countri
which
has
taken
refug
here
or
in
the
harbor
of
the
empire

our
stock
of
food
of
all
kind
are
far
more
abund
than
in
the
day
of
peac

and
a
larg
and
grow
program
of
food
product
is
on
foot


whi
do
i
say
all
this

not

assur

to
boast

not

assur

to
give
the
slightest
counten
to
complac

the
danger
we
face
are
still
enorm

but
so
are
our
advantag
and
resourc

i
recount
them
becaus
the
peopl
have
a
right
to
know
that
there
are
solid
ground
for
the
confid
which
we
feel

and
that
we
have
good
reason
to
believ
ourselv
capabl

as
i
said
in
a
veri
dark
hour
two
month
ago

of
continu
the
war

if
necessari
alon

if
necessari
for
year


i
say
it
also
becaus
the
fact
that
the
british
empire
stand
invinc

and
that
nazidom
is
still
be
resist

will
kindl
again
the
spark
of
hope
in
the
breast
of
hundr
of
million
of
down
trodden
or
despair
men
and
women
throughout
europ

and
far
beyond
it
bound

and
that
from
these
spark
there
will
present
come
cleans
and
devour
flame


the
great
air
battl
which
has
been
in
progress
over
this
island
for
the
last
few
week
has
recent
attain
a
high
intens

it
is
too
soon
to
attempt
to
assign
limit
either
to
it
scale
or
to
it
durat

we
must
certain
expect
that
greater
effort
will
be
made
by
the
enemi
than
ani
he
has
so
far
put
forth

hostil
air
field
are
still
be
develop
in
franc
and
the
low
countri

and
the
movement
of
squadron
and
materi
for
attack
us
is
still
proceed

it
is
quit
plain
that
herr
hitler
could
not
admit
defeat
in
his
air
attack
on
great
britain
without
sustain
most
serious
injuri

if
after
all
his
boast
and
bloodcurdl
threat
and
lurid
account
trumpet
round
the
world
of
the
damag
he
has
inflict

of
the
vast
number
of
our
air
forc
he
has
shot
down

so
he
say

with
so
littl
loss
to
himself

if
after
tale
of
the
panic
stricken
british
crush
in
their
hole
curs
the
plutocrat
parliament
which
has
led
them
to
such
a
plight
if
after
all
this
his
whole
air
onslaught
were
forc
after
a
while
tame
to
peter
out

the
fuhrer
s
reput
for
verac
of
statement
might
be
serious
impugn

we
may
be
sure

therefor

that
he
will
continu
as
long
as
he
has
the
strength
to
do
so

and
as
long
as
ani
preoccup
he
may
have
in
respect
of
the
russian
air
forc
allow
him
to
do
so


on
the
other
hand

the
condit
and
cours
of
the
fight
have
so
far
been
favor
to
us

i
told
the
hous
two
month
ago
that

wherea
in
franc
our
fighter
aircraft
were
wont
to
inflict
a
loss
of
two
or
three
to
one
upon
the
german

and
in
the
fight
at
dunkirk

which
was
a
kind

we

we

a

this
has
certain
come

it

all

that

that

is
the
crime

not

of

the

we
have
profound

our

with

is
not

in

and
his

that

take

these

in

to

but
this
convict
which
i
feel
of
the
futur
cannot
affect
the
immedi
problem
which
confront
us
in
the

and
in

it
had
been
decid
some

befor
the
begin
of

not
to
defend
the

of

that
polici
was
chang

when
the

when
our

a

a

were
attack
by
all
the

near

which

it

for

elsewher

far
larger

no

impend
in

more

that
i

at

a

of

we

than

we

and
we
have
told
gener
de

that
our

will
carri
with

the

of

i
do
not

it
would
be

at

while
the

the

is
still
perhap
onli
in

but
befor
we

undertak
the

we
have
not

we
have
to
convinc
all

broken

the

that

there
is

howev

one
direct
in

we
can
see
a

we
have
to

not

for

of
the

principl
for
which
we
are
fight
and
of
the
long
futur
of
the

commonwealth
of

some
month

we
came
to
the
conclus
that
the
interest
of
the

and
of
the
british
empire
both
requir
that
the

should
have
facil

defens
of
the
western
hemispher
against
the

of

which
might
have
acquir
temporari
but
lengthi
control
of
a
larg

of

and
it
formid
resourc

we
had
therefor
decid
spontan

and
without

or

ani
induc

to
inform
the

of

that
we
would
be
glad
to
place
such

facil
at
their

by

suitabl
site
in

possess
for
their
greater
secur
against

of

the

befor

various

had
been
reach
about
certain
small

in
the

which
had
becom

in
all
this
line
of
thought
we
found
ourselv
in
veri
close
harmoni
with

present
we
learn
that
anxieti
was
also
felt
in
the

about
the
air
and
naval
defens
of
their
atlantic

and
presid
roosevelt
has
recent
made
it
clear
that
he
would
like
to
discuss
with
us

and
with
the

of

and
with

the
develop

there
is

of

no

for

we
feel

the

of

a

preliminari
stage
of

of
the
greatest

in

that
we
are

the
polit
reconstruct

will
make
allow

all
allow

for
ani
lack
of
ceremoni
with
which
it
has
been
necessari
to
act

i
would
say
to
the
hous

as
i
said
to
those
who
have
join
this
govern


i
have
noth
to
offer
but
blood

toil

tear
and
sweat



we
have
befor
us
an
ordeal
of
the
most
grievous
kind

we
have
befor
us
mani

mani
long
month
of
struggl
and
of
suffer

you
ask

what
is
our
polici

i
can
say

it
is
to
wage
war

by
sea

land
and
air

with
all
our
might
and
with
all
the
strength
that
god
can
give
us

to
wage
war
against
a
monstrous
tyranni

never
surpass
in
the
dark

lament
catalogu
of
human
crime

that
is
our
polici

you
ask

what
is
our
aim

i
can
answer
in
one
word

it
is
victori

victori
at
all
cost

victori
in
spite
of
all
terror

victori

howev
long
and
hard
the
road
may
be

for
without
victori

there
is
no
surviv

let
that
be
realis

no
surviv
for
the
british
empire

no
surviv
for
all
that
the
british
empire
has
stood
for

no
surviv
for
the
urg
and
impuls
of
the
age

that
mankind
will
move
forward
toward
it
goal

but
i
take
up
my
task
with
buoyanc
and
hope

i
feel
sure
that
our
caus
will
not
be
suffer
to
fail
among
men

at
this
time
i
feel
entitl
to
claim
the
aid
of
all

and
i
say


come
then

let
us
go
forward
togeth
with
our
unit
strength


i
spoke
the
other
day
of
the
coloss
militari
disast
which
occur
when
the
french
high
command
fail
to
withdraw
the
northern
armi
from
belgium
at
the
moment
when
they
knew
that
the
french
front
was
decis
broken
at
sedan
and
on
the
meus

this
delay
entail
the
loss
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
french
divis
and
threw
out
of
action
for
the
critic
period
the
whole
of
the
british
expeditionari
forc

our
armi
and
120
000
french
troop
were
inde
rescu
by
the
british
navi
from
dunkirk
but
onli
with
the
loss
of
their
cannon

vehicl
and
modern
equip

this
loss
inevit
took
some
week
to
repair

and
in
the
first
two
of
those
week
the
battl
in
franc
has
been
lost

when
we
consid
the
heroic
resist
made
by
the
french
armi
against
heavi
odd
in
this
battl

the
enorm
loss
inflict
upon
the
enemi
and
the
evid
exhaust
of
the
enemi

it
may
well
be
the
thought
that
these
25
divis
of
the
best
train
and
best
equip
troop
might
have
turn
the
scale

howev

gener
weygand
had
to
fight
without
them

onli
three
british
divis
or
their
equival
were
abl
to
stand
in
the
line
with
their
french
comrad

they
have
suffer
sever

but
they
have
fought
well

we
sent
everi
man
we
could
to
franc
as
fast
as
we
could
re
equip
and
transport
their
format


i
am
not
recit
these
fact
for
the
purpos
of
recrimin

that
i
judg
to
be
utter
futil
and
even
harm

we
cannot
afford
it

i
recit
them
in
order
to
explain
whi
it
was
we
did
not
have

as
we
could
have
had

between
twelv
and
fourteen
british
divis
fight
in
the
line
in
this
great
battl
instead
of
onli
three

now
i
put
all
this
asid

i
put
it
on
the
shelf

from
which
the
historian

when
they
have
time

will
select
their
document
to
tell
their
stori

we
have
to
think
of
the
futur
and
not
of
the
past

this
also
appli
in
a
small
way
to
our
own
affair
at
home

there
are
mani
who
would
hold
an
inquest
in
the
hous
of
common
on
the
conduct
of
the
govern



and
of
parliament

for
they
are
in
it

too



dure
the
year
which
led
up
to
this
catastroph

they
seek
to
indict
those
who
were
respons
for
the
guidanc
of
our
affair

this
also
would
be
a
foolish
and
pernici
process

there
are
too
mani
in
it

let
each
man
search
his
conscienc
and
search
his
speech

i
frequent
search
mine


of
this
i
am
quit
sure

that
if
we
open
a
quarrel
between
the
past
and
the
present

we
shall
find
that
we
have
lost
the
futur

therefor

i
cannot
accept
the
draw
of
ani
distinct
between
member
of
the
present
govern

it
was
form
at
a
moment
of
crisi
in
order
to
unit
all
the
parti
and
all
section
of
opinion

it
has
receiv
the
almost
unanim
support
of
both
hous
of
parliament

its
member
are
go
to
stand
togeth

and

subject
to
the
author
of
the
hous
of
common

we
are
go
to
govern
the
countri
and
fight
the
war

it
is
absolut
necessari
at
a
time
like
this
that
everi
minist
who
tri
each
day
to
do
his
duti
shall
be
respect

and
their
subordin
must
know
that
their
chief
are
not
threaten
men

men
who
are
here
today
and
gone
tomorrow

but
that
their
direct
must
be
punctual
and
faith
obey

without
this
concentr
power
we
cannot
face
what
lie
befor
us

i
should
not
think
it
would
be
veri
advantag
for
the
hous
to
prolong
this
debat
this
afternoon
under
condit
of
public
stress

mani
fact
are
not
clear
that
will
be
clear
in
a
short
time

we
are
to
have
a
secret
session
on
thursday

and
i
should
think
that
would
be
a
better
opportun
for
the
mani
earnest
express
of
opinion
which
member
will
desir
to
make
and
for
the
hous
to
discuss
vital
matter
without
have
everyth
read
the
next
morn
by
our
danger
foe


the

indic
a

as
clear
as
i
could
to
the

that
the
worst
possibl
were
open

and
i
made
it
perfect
clear
that
whatev
happen
in

would
make
no
differ
to
the

of

and
the
british

to
fight
on

if
necessari

did

i
must
make
it
clear
that

apart

and

onli
twelv

were

to
fight
upon
a
scale
which
justifi

and
this
was
fulli
up
to
the
number
which
the
french
had
been
led
to
expect
would
be
avail
in
franc
at
the
ninth
month
of

the
rest
of
our

at

have
a

valu
for
home
defens
which
will

of
cours

steadili
increas
everi

that

thus

the
invas
of
great
britain
would
at
this
time
requir
the
transport
across
the
sea
of
hostil
armi
on
a
veri
larg
scale

and
after
they
had
been
so
transport
they
would
have
to
be
continu
maintain
with
all
the
mass
of
munit
and
suppli
which
are
requir
for
continu
battl



as
continu
battl
it
will
sure
be


here
is
where
we
come
to
the
navi



and
after
all

we
have
a
navi

some
peopl
seem
to
forget
that
we
have
a
navi

we
must
remind
them

for
the
last
thirti
year
i
have
been
concern
in
discuss
about
the
possibl
of
oversea
invas

and
i
took
the
respons
on
behalf
of
the
admiralti

at
the
begin
of
the
last
war

of
allow
all
regular
troop
to
be
sent
out
of
the
countri

that
was
a
veri
serious
step
to
take

becaus
our
territori
had
onli
just
been
call
up
and
were
quit
untrain

therefor

this
island
was
for
sever
month
particular
denud
of
fight
troop

the
admiralti
had
confid
at
that
time
in
their
abil
to
prevent
a
mass
invas
even
though
at
that
time
the
german
had
a
magnific
battl
fleet
in
the
proport
of
10
to
16

even
though
they
were
capabl
of
fight
a
general
engag
everi
day
and
ani
day

wherea
now
they
have
onli
a
coupl
of
heavi
ship
worth
speak
of



the
scharnhorst
and
the
gneisenau

we
are
also
told
that
the
italian
navi
is
to
come
out
and
gain
sea
superior
in
these
water

if
they
serious
intend
it

i
shall
onli
say
that
we
shall
be
delight
to
offer
signor
mussolini
a
free
and
safeguard
passag
through
the
strait
of
gibraltar
in
order
that
he
may
play
the
part
to
which
he
aspir

there
is
a
general
curios
in
the
british
fleet
to
find
out
whether
the
italian
are
up
to
the
level
they
were
at
in
the
last
war
or
whether
they
have
fallen
off
at
all


therefor

it
seem
to
me
that
as
far
as
sea
born
invas
on
a
great
scale
is
concern

we
are
far
more
capabl
of
meet
it
today
than
we
were
at
mani
period
in
the
last
war
and
dure
the
earli
month
of
this
war

befor
our
other
troop
were
train

and
while
the
b
e
f

had
proceed
abroad

now

the
navi
have
never
pretend
to
be
abl
to
prevent
raid
by
bodi
of
5
000
or
10
000
men
flung
sudden
across
and
thrown
ashor
at
sever
point
on
the
coast
some
dark
night
or
foggi
morn

the
efficaci
of
sea
power

especi
under
modern
condit

depend
upon
the
invad
forc
be
of
larg
size

it
has
to
be
of
larg
size

in
view
of
our
militari
strength

to
be
of
ani
use

if
it
is
of
larg
size

then
the
navi
have
someth
they
can
find
and
meet
and

as
it
were

bite
on

now

we
must
rememb
that
even
five
divis

howev
light
equip

would
requir
200
to
250
ship

and
with
modern
air
reconnaiss
and
photographi
it
would
not
be
easi
to
collect
such
an
armada

marshal
it

and
conduct
it
across
the
sea
without
ani
power
naval
forc
to
escort
it

and
there
would
be
veri
great
possibl

to
put
it
mild

that
this
armada
would
be
intercept
long
befor
it
reach
the
coast

and
all
the
men
drown
in
the
sea
or

at
the
worst
blown
to
piec
with
their
equip
while
they
were
tri
to
land

we
also
have
a
great
system
of
minefield

recent
strong
reinforc

through
which
we
alon
know
the
channel

if
the
enemi
tri
to
sweep
passag
through
these
minefield

it
will
be
the
task
of
the
navi
to
destroy
the
mine
sweeper
and
ani
other
forc
employ
to
protect
them

there
should
be
no
difficulti
in
this

owe
to
our
great
superior
at
sea


those
are
the
regular

well
test

well
prove
argument
on
which
we
have
reli
dure
mani
year
in
peac
and
war

but
the
question
is
whether
there
are
ani
new
method
by
which
those
solid
assur
can
be
circumv

odd
as
it
may
seem

some
attent
has
been
given
to
this
by
the
admiralti

whose
prime
duti
and
respons
is
to
destroy
ani
larg
sea
born
expedit
befor
it
reach

or
at
the
moment
when
it
reach

these
shore

it
would
not
be
a
good
thing
for
me
to
go
into
detail
of
this

it
might
suggest
idea
to
other
peopl
which
they
have
not
thought
of

and
they
would
not
be
like
to
give
us
ani
of
their
idea
in
exchang

all
i
will
say
is
that
untir
vigil
and
mind
search
must
be
devot
to
the
subject

becaus
the
enemi
is
crafti
and
cun
and
full
of
novel
treacheri
and
stratagem

the
hous
may
be
assur
that
the
utmost
ingenu
is
be
display
and
imagin
is
be
evok
from
larg
number
of
compet
offic

well
train
in
tactic
and
thorough
up
to

to
measur
and
counterwork
novel
possibl

untire
vigil
and
untir
search
of
the
mind
is
be

and
must
be

devot
to
the
subject

becaus

rememb

the
enemi
is
crafti
and
there
is
no
dirti
trick
he
will
not
do


some
peopl
will
ask
whi

then

was
it
that
the
british
navi
was
not
abl
to
prevent
the
movement
of
a
larg
armi
from
germani
into
norway
across
the
skagerrak

but
the
condit
in
the
channel
and
in
the
north
sea
are
in
no
way
like
those
which
prevail
in
the
skagerrak

in
the
skagerrak

becaus
of
the
distanc

we
could
give
no
air
support
to
our
surfac
ship

and
consequ

lie
as
we
did
close
to
the
enemi
s
main
air
power

we
were
compel
to
use
onli
our
submarin

we
could
not
enforc
the
decis
blockad
or
interrupt
which
is
possibl
from
surfac
vessel

our
submarin
took
a
heavi
toll
but
could
not

by
themselv

prevent
the
invas
of
norway

in
the
channel
and
in
the
north
sea

on
the
other
hand

our
superior
naval
surfac
forc

aid
by
our
submarin

will
oper
with
close
and
effect
air
assist


this
bring
me

natur

to
the
great
question
of
invas
from
the
air

and
of
the
impend
struggl
between
the
british
and
german
air
forc

it
seem
quit
clear
that
no
invas
on
a
scale
beyond
the
capac
of
our
land
forc
to
crush
speedili
is
like
to
take
place
from
the
air
until
our
air
forc
has
been
definit
overpow

in
the
meantim

there
may
be
raid
by
parachut
troop
and
attempt
descent
of
airborn
soldier

we
should
be
abl
to
give
those
gentri
a
warm
recept
both
in
the
air
and
on
the
ground

if
they
reach
it
in
ani
condit
to
continu
the
disput

but
the
great
question
is

can
we
break
hitler
s
air
weapon

now

of
cours

it
is
a
veri
great
piti
that
we
have
not
got
an
air
forc
at
least
equal
to
that
of
the
most
power
enemi
within
strike
distanc
of
these
shore

but
we
have
a
veri
power
air
forc
which
has
prove
itself
far
superior
in
qualiti

both
in
men
and
in
mani
type
of
machin

to
what
we
have
met
so
far
in
the
numer
and
fierc
air
battl
which
have
been
fought
with
the
german

in
franc

where
we
were
at
a
consider
disadvantag
and
lost
mani
machin
on
the
ground
when
they
were
stand
round
the
aerodrom

we
were
accustom
to
inflict
in
the
air
loss
of
as
much
as
two
and
two
and
a
half
to
one

in
the
fight
over
dunkirk

which
was
a
sort
of
no
man
s
land

we
undoubt
beat
the
german
air
forc

and
gain
the
masteri
of
the
local
air

inflict
here
a
loss
of
three
or
four
to
one
day
after
day

anyon
who
look
at
the
photograph
which
were
publish
a
week
or
so
ago
of
the
re
embark

show
the
mass
of
troop
assembl
on
the
beach
and
form
an
ideal
target
for
hour
at
a
time

must
realiz
that
this
re
embark
would
not
have
been
possibl
unless
the
enemi
had
resign
all
hope
of
recov
air
superior
at
that
time
and
at
that
place


in
the
defens
of
this
island
the
advantag
to
the
defend
will
be
much
greater
than
they
were
in
the
fight
around
dunkirk

we
hope
to
improv
on
the
rate
of
three
or
four
to
one
which
was
realiz
at
dunkirk

and
in
addit
all
our
injur
machin
and
their

which
get
down
safe



and

surpris

a
veri
great
mani
injur
machin
and
men
do
get
down
safe
in
modern

fight



all
of
these
will
fall

in
an
attack
upon
these
island

on
friend
soil
and
live
to
fight
anoth
day

wherea
all
the
injur
enemi
machin
and
their
complement
will
be
total
loss
as
far
as
the
war
is
concern


dure
the
great
battl
in
franc

we
gave
veri
power
and
continu
aid
to
the
french
armi

both
by
fighter
and
bomber

but
in
spite
of
everi
kind
of
pressur
we
never
would
allow
the
entir
metropolitan
fighter
strength
of
the
air
forc
to
be
consum

this
decis
was
pain

but
it
was
also
right

becaus
the
fortun
of
the
battl
in
franc
could
not
have
been
decis
affect
even
if
we
had
thrown
in
our
entir
fighter
forc

that
battl
was
lost
by
the
unfortun
strateg
open

by
the
extraordinari
and
unforseen
power
of
the
armor
column

and
by
the
great
preponder
of
the
german
armi
in
number

our
fighter
air
forc
might
easili
have
been
exhaust
as
a
mere
accid
in
that
great
struggl

and
then
we
should
have
found
ourselv
at
the
present

in
a
veri
serious
plight

but
as
it
is

i
am
happi
to
inform
the
hous
that
our
fighter
strength
is
stronger
at
the
present
time
relat
to
the
german

who
have
suffer
terribl
loss

than
it
has
ever
been

and
consequ
we
believ
ourselv
possess
of
the
capac
to
continu
the
war
in
the
air
under
better
condit
than
we
have
ever
experienc
befor

i
look

confid

the

of

these
splendid

this
brilliant

who
will
have
the
glori
of
save
their

their

home

and
all
they
love

from
the
most
dead
of
all
attack


there
remain

of
cours

the
danger
of
bomb
attack

which
will
certain
be
made
veri
soon
upon
us
by
the
bomber
forc
of
the
enemi

it
is
true
that
the
german
bomber
forc
is
superior
in
number
to
our

but
we
have
a
veri
larg
bomber
forc
also

which
we
shall
use
to
strike
at
militari
target
in
germani
without
intermiss

i
do
not
at
all
underr
the
sever
of
the
ordeal
which
lie
befor

but
i
believ
our

will
show
themselv
capabl
of

like
the

of

and
will
be

and
carri

at

we
may
now
ask
ourselv

in
what
way
has
our

worsen
sinc
the
begin
of

it
has
worsen
by
the
fact
that

conquer
a

part
of

line
of
western
europ

and
mani
small

have
been
overrun
by

this
aggrav
the
possibl
of

it
in

diminish

on

the

the

of

into

increas
the
power
of
our

blockad

we
have
stop
the
worst
leak
by
that

we
do
not
know
whether
militari
resist
will
come
to
an
end
in

or
not

but
should
it
do
so

then
of

the
german
will
be
abl
to
concentr
their

both
militari

upon

but
for
the
reason
i

given
to

these

not

as
no

we

be

far
larger

if

i

which

for

run

veri

we
must
not
forget
that
from
the
moment
when
we
declar
war
on
the
3rd
septemb
it
was
alway
possibl
for

to
turn
all

togeth
with

we

therefor

live

in

dure

and
yet
at

of

the

was
higher

of

everywher

invad

dure
that

we
repeat
ask
ourselv
the

how

and
no

our

we

whether
the

both

the

upon

the

upon

hitler
know

if

all

but
if

fail

then
the
whole

includ
the

includ
all

will
sink

of

made

and
perhap
more

by

let
us
therefor
brace
ourselv

and
so
bear
ourselv
that
if
the
british

and
it
commonwealth
last
for
a
thousand

men
will
still
say


this
was
their
finest
hour


from
the
moment
that
the
french
defenc
at
sedan
and
on
the

were
broken
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
of
may

onli
a
rapid
retreat
to
amien
and
the
south
could
have
save
the
british

french
armi
who
had
enter
belgium
at
the
appeal
of
the
belgian
king

but
this
strateg
fact
was
not
immedi
realis

the
french
high
command
hope
they
would
be
abl
to
close
the
gap

and
the
armi
of
the
north
were
under
their
order

moreov

a
retir
of
this
kind
would
have
involv
almost
certain
the
destruct
of
the
fine
belgian
armi
of
over
20
divis
and
the
abandon
of
the
whole
of
belgium

therefor

when
the
forc
and
scope
of
the
german
penetr
were
realis
and
when
a
new

generalissimo

gener
weygand

assum

in

of

gamelin

an
effort
was
made
by
the
french
and
british
armi
in
belgium
to
keep
on
hold
the
right
hand
of
the
belgian
and
to
give
their
own
right

to
a
newli
creat
french
armi
which
was
to
have
advanc
across
the
somm
in
great
strength
to
grasp
it


howev

the
german
erupt
swept
like
a
sharp
scyth
around
the
right
and
rear
of
the
armi
of
the
north

eight
or
nine
armour
divis

each
of
about
four
hundr
armour
vehicl
of
differ

but
care
assort
to
be
complementari
and
divis
into
small
self
contain
unit

cut
off
all
communic
between
us
and
the
main
french

it
sever
our
own
communic
for

and

which
ran
first
to
amien
and
afterward
through
abbevill

and
it
shore
it
way
up
the
coast
to
boulogn
and
calai

and
almost
to
dunkirk

behind
this
armour
and
mechanis
onslaught
came
a
number
of
german

in
lorri

and
behind
them
again
there
plod
compar
slowli
the

mass
of

alway

not

boulogn

were
the

were
then
withdrawn
by
order
from

the

the
60th

and
the
queen

with
a
battalion
of

and
1
000
frenchmen

in
all
about
four
thousand

defend
calai
to
the

the
british

was
given
an

to

he
spurn
the

and
four
day
of

pass
befor

which
mark
the
end
of
a

onli
30
unwound
survivor
were
brought
off

and
we
do
not

the
fate
of

their

howev

was
not
in

at

two
armour
divis

which
otherwis
would
have
been
turn
against
the
british

forc

had
to

they

and
the
time
gain
enabl
the
gravelin
water
line
to

and
to
be

thus
it
was
that
the
port
of
dunkirk
was
kept
open

when
it
was
found
imposs
for
the
armi
of
the
north
to
reopen
their
communic
to

with
the
main
french
armi

onli
one
choic
remain

it
seem

inde

forlorn

the
belgian

british
and
french
armi
were
almost
surround

their
sole
line
of
retreat
was
to
a
singl
port
and
to
it
neighbor
beach

they
were
press
on
everi
side
by
heavi
attack
and
far
outnumb
in
the
air


when

a
week
ago
today

i
ask
the
hous
to
fix
this
afternoon
as
the
occas
for
a
statement

i
fear
it
would
be
my
hard
lot
to
announc
the
greatest
militari
disast
in
our
long
histori

i
thought


and
some
good
judg
agre
with
me

that
perhap
20
000
or
30
000
men
might
be
re
embark

but
it
certain
seem
that
the
whole
of
the
french
first
armi
and
the
whole
of
the
british
expeditionari
forc
north
of
the
amien
abbevill
gap
would
be
broken
up
in
the
open
field
or
els
would
have
to
capitul
for
lack
of
food
and
ammunit

these
were
the
hard
and
heavi
tide
for
which
i
call
upon
the
hous
and
the
nation
to
prepar
themselv
a
week
ago

the
whole
root
and
core
and
brain
of
the
british
armi

on
which
and
around
which
we
were
to
build

and
are
to
build

the
great
british
armi
in
the
later
year
of
the
war

seem
about
to
perish
upon
the
field
or
to
be
led
into
an
ignomini
and
starv
captiv


that
was
the
prospect
a
week
ago

but
anoth
blow
which
might
well
have
prove
final
was
yet
to
fall
upon
us

the
king
of
the
belgian
had
call
upon
us
to
come
to
his
aid

had
not
this
ruler
and
his
govern
sever
themselv
from
the
alli

who
rescu
their
countri
from
extinct
in
the
late
war

and
had
they
not
sought
refug
in
what
was
prove
to
be
a
fatal
neutral

the
french
and
british
armi
might
well
at
the
outset
have
save
not
onli
belgium
but
perhap
even
poland

yet
at
the
last
moment

when
belgium
was
alreadi
invad

king
leopold
call
upon
us
to
come
to
his
aid

and
even
at
the
last
moment
we
came

he
and
his
brave

effici
armi

near
half
a
million
strong

guard
our
left
flank
and
thus
kept
open
our
onli
line
of
retreat
to
the
sea

sudden

without
prior
consult

with
the
least
possibl
notic

without
the
advic
of
his
minist
and
upon
his
own
person
act

he
sent
a
plenipotentiari
to
the
german
command

surrend
his
armi

and
expos
our
whole
flank
and
mean
of
retreat


i
ask
the
hous
a
week
ago
to
suspend
it
judgement
becaus
the
fact
were
not
clear

but
i
do
not
feel
that
ani
reason
now
exist
whi
we
should
not
form
our
own
opinion
upon
this
piti
episod

the
surrend
of
the
belgian
armi
compel
the
british
at
the
shortest
notic
to
cover
a
flank
to
the
sea
more
than
30
mile
in
length

otherwis
all
would
have
been
cut
off

and
all
would
have
share
the
fate
to
which
king
leopold
had
condemn
the
finest
armi
his
countri
had
ever
form

so
in
do
this
and
in
expos
this
flank

as
anyon
who
follow
the
oper
on
the
map
will
see

contact
was
lost
between
the
british
and
two
out
of
the
three
corp
form
the
first
french
armi

who
were
still
farther
from
the
coast
than
we
were

and
it
seem
imposs
that
ani
larg

of

could
reach

can
you
conceiv

to
make

imposs

and
to
sink
all

almost

i
take
occas
to
express
the

to
all

the

sir

his

and
mani
in

have

the

i
will
say
this
about
the

we
have
had
a

come

i
would
say
about

that

report

who
will
come

some

in

in

it
is
inevit
that

been
left
in

where
honour
requir
no

against
this
loss
of
over
30
000
men

we
can
set
a
far
heavier
loss
certain
inflict
upon
the
enemi

but
our
loss
in
materi
are
enorm

we
have
perhap
lost
one
third
of
the
men
we
lost
in
the
open
day
of
the
battl
of
21st
march

1918

but
we
have
lost
near
as
mani
gun



near
one
thousand


and
all
our
transport

all
the
armour
vehicl
that
were
with
the
armi
in
the
north

this
loss
will
impos
a
further
delay
on
the
expans
of
our
militari
strength

that
expans
had
not
been
proceed
as
far
as
we
had
hope

the
best
of
all
we
had
to
give
had
gone
to
the
british
expeditionari
forc

and
although
they
had
not
the
number
of
tank
and
some
articl
of
equip
which
were
desir

they
were
a
veri
well
and
fine
equip
armi

they
had
the
first
fruit
of
all
that
our
industri
had
to
give

and
that
is
gone

and
now
here
is
this
further
delay

how
long
it
will
be

how
long
it
will
last

depend
upon
the
exert
which
we
make
in
this
island

an
effort
the
like
of
which
has
never
been
seen
in
our
record
is
now
be
made

work
is
proceed
everywher

night

sunday
and
week
day

capit

labour
have
cast
asid
their

right

and
custom
and
put
them
into
the
common
stock

alreadi
the
flow
of
munit
has
leap
forward

there
is
no
reason
whi
we
should
not
in
a
few
month
overtak
the
sudden
and
serious
loss
that
has
come
upon
us

without
retard
the
develop
of

nevertheless

our
thank
at
the
escap
of
our
armi
and
so
mani
men

whose
love
one
have
pass
through
an
agonis
week

must
not
blind
us
to
the
fact
that
what
has
happen
in

and
belgium
is
a
coloss
militari
disast

the
french
armi
has
been
weaken

the
belgian
armi
has
been
lost

a
larg
part
of
those
fortifi
line
upon
which
so
much
faith
had
been
repos
is
gone

mani
valuabl
mine
district
and
factori
have
pass
into
the
enemi
s
possess

the
whole
of
the
channel
port
are
in
his
hand

with
all
the
tragic
consequ
that
follow
from
that

and
we
must
expect
anoth
blow
to
be
struck
almost
immedi
at
us
or
at
franc

we
are
told
that
herr
hitler
has
a
plan
for
invad
the
british
isles

this
has
often
been
thought
of
befor

when
napoleon
lay
at
boulogn
for
a
year
with
his
flat
bottom
boat
and
his
grand
armi

he
was
told
by
someon


there
are
bitter
weed
in
england


there
are
certain
a
great
mani
more
of
them
sinc
the
british
expeditionari
forc
return


the
whole
question
of
home
defenc
against
invas
is

of
cours

power
affect
by
the
fact
that
we
have
for
the
time
be
in
this
island
incompar
more
power
militari
forc
than
we
have
ever
had
at
ani
moment
in
this
war
or
the
last

but
this
will
not
continu

we
shall
not
be
content
with
a
defens
war

we
have
our
duti
to
our
alli

we
have
to
reconstitut
and
build
up
the
british
expeditionari
forc
onc
again

under
it
gallant
command
in
chief

lord
gort

all
this
is
in
train

but
in
the
interv
we
must
put
our
defenc
in
this
island
into
such
a
high
state
of
organis
that
the
fewest
possibl
number
will
be
requir

and
that
the
largest
possibl
potenti

may
be
realis

on
this
we
are
now
engag

it
will
be
veri
conveni

if
it
be

to

in

not
that
the

would
necessarili
be

but
we
like
to
have
our

free

without
the

impos
by
the
fact
that
they
will
be
read
the

made
upon

which
will
be
readili
acced

we

not

are
the

i

but
we
cannot

at

under

draw
all

like
to
do

if

these

out

for

as
well
as
for
our

there
is

howev

anoth
class

for
which
i
feel
not
the

parliament
has
given
us
the

to
put

and
we
shall
use
those
power
subject
to
the

correct
of

without
the

hesit
until
we
are
satisfi

and
more
than
satisfi

that

has
been

stamp
out


turn
onc
again

and
this
time
more
general

to
the
question
of

i
would
observ
that
there
has
never
been
a
period
in
all
these
long
centuri
of
which
we
boast
when
an
absolut
guarante
against

still
less
against
serious
raid

could
have
been
given
to
our
peopl

in
the
day
of
napoleon
the
same
wind
which
would
have
carri
his
transport
across
the
channel
might
have
driven
away
the
blockad
fleet

there
was
alway
the

and
it
is
that
chanc
which
has
excit
and
befool
the
imagin
of
mani
continent
tyrant

mani
are
the
tale
that
are
told

we
are
assur
that
novel
method
will
be
adopt

and
when
we
see
the
origin
of
malic

the
ingenu
of

which
our
enemi
display

we
may
certain
prepar
ourselv
for
everi
kind
of
novel
stratagem
and
everi
kind
of
brutal
and
treacher
maneuv

i
think
that
no
idea
is
so
outlandish
that
it
should
not
be
consid
and
view
with
a
search

but
at
the
same
time

i
hope

with
a
steadi
eye

we
must
never
forget
the
solid
assur
of

power
and
those
which
belong
to

power
if

i

myself

if

if

there
is
anoth
more
obvious
differ
from
1914

the
whole
of
the

nation
are
engag

not
onli
soldier

but
the
entir
popul

men

women
and

the

are
everywher

the

the

the

with

but
the

these
are
great
and
distinct
chang
from
what
mani
of
us
saw
in
the
struggl
of
a
quarter
of
a

there
seem
to
be
everi
reason
to
believ
that
this
new
kind
of
war
is
well
suit
to
the
genius
and
the
resourc
of
the
british
nation
and
the
british

and
that

onc
we
get
proper
equip
and
proper
start

a
war
of
this
kind
will
be
more
favor
to
us
than
the
sombr
mass
slaughter
of
the

passchendael

if
it
is
a
case
of
the
whole
nation
fight
and
suffer
togeth

that
ought
to
suit
us

becaus
we
are
the
most
unit
of
all
the
nation

becaus
we
enter
the
war
upon
the
nation
will
and
with
our
eye
open

and
becaus
we
have
been
nurtur
in
freedom
and
individu
respons
and
are
the
product

not
of
totalitarian
uniform

but
of
toler

varieti

if
all
these
qualiti
are
turn

as
they
are
be
turn

to
the
art
of

we
may
be
abl
to
show
the
enemi
quit
a
lot
of
thing
that
they
have
not
thought
of
yet

sinc
the
german
drove
the
jew
out
and
lower
their
technic
standard

our
scienc
is
definit
ahead
of
their

our
geograph
posit

the
command
of
the

and
the
friendship
of
the
unite
state
enabl
us
to
draw
resourc
from
the
whole
world
and
to
manufactur
weapon
of
war
of
everi
kind

but
especi
of
the
superfin
kind

on
a
scale
hitherto
practic
onli
by
nazi
germani


hitler
is
now
sprawl
over
europ

our
offens
spring
are
be
slowli
compress

and
we
must
resolut
and
method
prepar
ourselv
for
the
campaign
of
1941
and
1942

two
or
three
year
are
not
a
long
time

even
in
our
short

precari
live

they
are
noth
in
the
histori
of
the
nation

and
when
we
are
do
the
finest
thing
in
the
world

and
have
the
honor
to
be
the
sole
champion
of
the
liberti
of
all
europ

we
must
not
grudg
these
year
or
weari
as
we
toil
and
struggl
through
them

it
doe
not
follow
that
our
energi
in
futur
year
will
be
exclus
confin
to
defend
ourselv
and
our
possess

mani
opportun
may
lie
open
to
amphibi
power

and
we
must
be
readi
to
take
advantag
of
them

one
of
the
way
to
bring
this
war
to
a
speedi
end
is
to
convinc
the
enemi

not
by
word

but
by
deed

that
we
have
both
the
will
and
the
mean

not
onli
to
go
on
indefinit

but
to
strike
heavi
and
unexpect
blow

the
road
to
victori
may
not
be
so
long
as
we
expect

but
we
have
no
right
to
count
upon
this

be
it
long
or
short

rough
or
smooth

we
mean
to
reach
our
journey
s
end


it
is
our
intent
to
maintain
and
enforc
a
strict
blockad

not
onli
of
germani

but
of
itali

franc

and
all
the
other
countri
that
have
fallen
into
the
german
power

i
read
in
the
paper
that
herr
hitler
has
also
proclaim
a
strict
blockad
of
the
british
island

no
one
can
complain
of
that

i
rememb
the
kaiser
do
it
in
the
last
war

what
inde
would
be
a
matter
of
general
complaint
would
be
if
we
were
to
prolong
the
agoni
of
all
europ
by
allow
food
to
come
in
to
nourish
the
nazi
and
aid
their
war
effort

or
to
allow
food
to
go
in
to
the
subjug
peopl

which
certain
would
be
pillag
off
them
by
their
nazi
conqueror


there
have
been
mani
propos

found
on
the
highest
motiv

that
food
should
be
allow
to
pass
the
blockad
for
the
relief
of
these
popul

i
regret
that
we
must
refus
these
request

the
nazi
declar
that
they
have
creat
a
new
unifi
economi
in

they
have
repeat
state
that
they
possess
ampl
reserv
of
food
and
that
they
can
feed
their

in
a

of

that

rather

should

than

let

the

find

our

we

lie

it
may
be
that
even
greater
ordeal
lie
befor

we
shall
face
whatev
is
come

we
are
sure
of
ourselv
and
of
our

and
that
is
the
suprem
fact
which
has
emerg
in
these
month
of
trial


meanwhil

we
have
not
onli
fortifi
our
heart
but
our
island

we
have
rearm
and
rebuilt
our
armi
in
a
degre
which
would
have
been
deem
imposs
a
few
month

we
have
ferri

the

work
as
they
have
never

befor

has
pour
forth
to

the
whole

is
at

more
than
2
000
000
determin
men
have
rifl
and
bayonet
in

tonight

and
three
quarter
of
them
are

we
have
never
had
armi
like
this
in
our
island
in
time
of

the
whole
island
bristl
against
invad

from
the
sea
or
from
the
air

as
i
explain
to
the
hous
in
the
middl
of
june

the
stronger
our
armi
at
home

the
larger
must
the
invad
expedit
be

and
the
larger
the
invad
expedit

the
less
difficult
will
be
the
task
of
the
navi
in
detect
it
assembl
and
in
intercept
and
destroy
it
in
passag

and
the
greater
also
would
be
the
difficulti
of
feed
and
suppli
the
invad
if
ever
they
land

in
the
teeth
of
continu
naval
and
air
attack
on
their
communic

all
this
is
classic
and
vener
doctrin

as
in
nelson
s
day

the
maxim
hold


our
first
line
of
defens
is
the
enemi
s
port


now
air
reconnaiss
and
photographi
have
brought
to
an
old
principl
a
new
and
potent
aid


our
navi
is
far
stronger
than
it
was
at
the
begin
of
the
war

the
great
flow
of
new
construct
set
on
foot
at
the
outbreak
is
now
begin
to
come
in

we
hope
our
friend
across
the
ocean
will
send
us
a
time
reinforc
to
bridg
the
gap
between
the
peac
flotilla
of
1939
and
the
war
flotilla
of
1941

there
is
no
difficulti
in
send
such
aid

the
sea
and
ocean
are
open

the
u
boat
are
contain

the
magnet
mine
is

up
to
the
present
time

effect
master

the
merchant
tonnag
under
the
british

after
a
year
of
unlimit
u
boat
war

after
eight
month
of
intens
mine
attack

is
larger
than
when
we
began

we
have

in
addit

under
our
control
at
least
4
000
000
ton
of
ship
from
the
captiv
countri
which
has
taken
refug
here
or
in
the
harbor
of
the
empire

our
stock
of
food
of
all
kind
are
far
more
abund
than
in
the
day
of
peac

and
a
larg
and
grow
programm
of
food
product
is
on
foot


whi
do
i
say
all
this

not

assur

to
boast

not

assur

to
give
the
slightest
counten
to
complac

the
danger
we
face
are
still
enorm

but
so
are
our
advantag
and
resourc

i
recount
them
becaus
the
peopl
have
a
right
to
know
that
there
are
solid
ground
for
the
confid
which
we
feel

and
that
we
have
good
reason
to
believ
ourselv
capabl

as
i
said
in
a
veri
dark
hour
two
month
ago

of
continu
the
war

if
necessari
alon

if
necessari
for
year


i
say
it
also
becaus
the
fact
that
the
british
empire
stand
invinc

and
that
nazidom
is
still
be
resist

will
kindl
again
the
spark
of
hope
in
the
breast
of
hundr
of
million
of
down
trodden
or
despair
men
and
women
throughout
europ

and
far
beyond
it
bound

and
that
from
these
spark
there
will
present
come
cleans
and
devour
flame


the
great
air
battl
which
has
been
in
progress
over
this
island
for
the
last
few
week
has
recent
attain
a
high
intens

it
is
too
soon
to
attempt
to
assign
limit
either
to
it
scale
or
to
it
durat

we
must
certain
expect
that
greater
effort
will
be
made
by
the
enemi
than
ani
he
has
so
far
put
forth

hostil
air
field
are
still
be
develop
in
franc
and
the
low
countri

and
the
movement
of
squadron
and
materi
for
attack
us
is
still
proceed

it
is
quit
plain
that
herr
hitler
could
not
admit
defeat
in
his
air
attack
on
great
britain
without
sustain
most
serious
injuri

if
after
all
his
boast
and
bloodcurdl
threat
and
lurid
account
trumpet
round
the
world
of
the
damag
he
has
inflict

of
the
vast
number
of
our
air
forc
he
has
shot
down

so
he
say

with
so
littl
loss
to
himself

if
after
tale
of
the
panic
stricken
british
crush
in
their
hole
curs
the
plutocrat
parliament
which
has
led
them
to
such
a
plight


if
after
all
this
his
whole
air
onslaught
were
forc
after
a
while
tame
to
peter
out

the
fuhrer
s
reput
for
verac
of
statement
might
be
serious
impugn

we
may
be
sure

therefor

that
he
will
continu
as
long
as
he
has
the
strength
to
do
so

and
as
long
as
ani
preoccup
he
may
have
in
respect
of
the
russian
air
forc
allow
him
to
do
so


on
the
other
hand

the
condit
and
cours
of
the
fight
have
so
far
been
favor
to
us

i
told
the
hous
two
month
ago
that

wherea
in
franc
our
fighter
aircraft
were
wont
to
inflict
a
loss
of
two
or
three
to
one
upon
the
german

and
in
the
fight
at
dunkirk

which
was
a
kind
of
no
man
s
land

a
loss
of
about
three
or
four
to
one

we
expect
that
in
an
attack
on
this
island
we
should
achiev
a
larger
ratio

this
has
certain
come
true

it
must
also
be
rememb
that
all
the
enemi
machin
and
pilot
which
are
shot
down
over
our
island

or
over
the
sea
which
surround
it

are
either
destroy
or
captur

wherea
a
consider
proport
of
our
machin

and
also
of
our
pilot

are
save

and
soon
again
in
mani
case
come
into
action


a
vast
and
admir
system
of
salvag

direct
by
the
ministri
of
aircraft
product

ensur
the
speediest
return
to
the

line
of
damag
machin

and
the
most
provid
and
speedi
use
of
all
the
spare
part
and
materi

at
the
same
time
the
splendid


nay

astound


increas
in
the
output
and
repair
of
british
aircraft
and
engin
which
lord
beaverbrook
has
achiev
by
a
genius
of
organ
and
drive

which
look
like
magic

has
given
us
overflow
reserv
of
everi
type
of
aircraft

and
an
ever
mount
stream
of
product
both
in
quantiti
and
qualiti

the
enemi
is

of
cours

far
more
numer
than
we
are

but
our
new
product
alreadi

as
i
am
advis

larg
exceed
his

and
the
american
product
is
onli
just
begin
to
flow
in

it
is
a
fact

as
i
see
from
my
daili
return

that
our
bomber
and
fighter
strength
now

after
all
this
fight

are
larger
than
they
have
ever
been

we
believ
that
we
shall
be
abl
to
continu
the
air
struggl
indefinit
and
as
long
as
the
enemi
pleas

and
the
longer
it
continu
the
more
rapid
will
be
our
approach

first
toward
that
pariti

and
then
into
that
superior

in
the
air
upon
which
in
a
larg
measur
the
decis
of
the

depend


the
gratitud
of
everi

the

that

is
the

not

of

the

we
have
profound

our

with

is
not

in

that

take

these

this
convict
which
i
feel
of

cannot
affect
the
immedi

which
confront
us
in

in

it
had
been
decid
some

befor
the
begin

not

that
polici
was
chang

when
the

a

were
attack
by
all
the

near

which
had

face

it
was

virtual

for

elsewher

far
larger

no

impend
in

i

not

we

we

we

to

more

that
i

at

a

of

we

than

we

and
we
have
told
gener
de

that
our

will
carri
with

the

i
do
not

it

be

at

while
the

perhap
onli
in

befor

we

the

that

there

howev

one
direct
in

we
have
to

not

for

for

secur
of
the
caus
and
principl
for
which
we
are
fight
and
of
the
long
futur
of
the
british
commonwealth
of

some
month
ago
we
came
to
the
conclus
that
the
interest
of
the
unite
state
and
of
the
british
empire
both
requir
that
the
unite
state
should
have
facil
for
the
naval
and
air
defenc
of
the
western
hemispher
against
the
attack
of
a
nazi
power
which
might
have
acquir
temporari
but
lengthi
control
of
a
larg
part
of
western
europ
and
it
formid
resourc

we
had
therefor
decid
spontan

and
without
be
ask
or
offer
ani
induc

to
inform
the
govern
of
the
unite
state
that
we
would
be
glad
to
place
such
defens
facil
at
their
dispos
by
leas
suitabl
site
in
our
transatlant
possess
for
their
greater
secur
against
the
unmeasur
danger
of
the
futur

the
principl
of
associ
of
interest
for
common
purpos
between
great
britain
and
the
unite
state
had
develop
even
befor
the
war

various
agreement
had
been
reach
about
certain
small
island
in
the
pacif
ocean
which
had
becom
import
as
air
fuel
point

in
all
this
line
of
thought
we
found
ourselv
in
veri
close
harmoni
with
the
govern
of
canada


present
we
learn
that
anxieti
was
also
felt
in
the
unite
state
about
the
air
and
naval
defens
of
their
atlantic
seaboard

and
presid
roosevelt
has
recent
made
it
clear
that
he
would
like
to
discuss
with
us

and
with
the
dominion
of
canada
and
with
newfoundland

the
develop
of
american
naval
and
air
facil
in
newfoundland
and
in
the
west
indi

there
is

of
cours

no
question
of
ani
transfer
of
sovereignti


that
has
never
been
suggest


or
of
ani
action
be
taken
without
the
consent
or
against
the
wish
of
the
various
coloni
concern

but
for
our
part

his
majesti
s
govern
are
entir
will
to
accord
defens
facil
to
the
unite
state
on
a
99
year

leasehold
basi

and
we
feel
sure
that
our
interest
no
less
than
their

and
the
interest
of
the
coloni
themselv
and
of
canada
and
newfoundland

will
be
serv
therebi

these
are
import
step

undoubt
this
process
mean
that
these
two
great
organ
of
the
english
speak
democraci

the
british
empire
and
the
unite
state

will
have
to
be
somewhat
mix
up
togeth
in
some
of
their
affair
for
mutual
and
general
advantag

for
my
own
part

look
out
upon
the
futur

i
do
not
view
the
process
with
ani
misgiv

i
could
not
stop
it
if
i
wish

no
one
can
stop
it

like
the
mississippi

it
just
keep
roll
along

let
it
roll

let
it
roll
on
full
flood

inexor

irresist

benign

to
broader
land
and
better
day

on
5
septemb
the
luftwaff
switch
tactic

sudden
the
weight
of
enemi
attack
was
concentr
no
longer
against
the
base
of
the
royal

forc

but
against
the
civilian
popul
of
london
and
other
major
citi

churchil
here
give
full
rein
to
his
outrag
and
reavow
his
determin
to
secur
victori


when
i
said
in
the
hous
of
common
the
other
day
that
i
thought
it
improb
that
the
enemi
s
air
attack
in
septemb
could
be
more
than
three
time
as
great
as
it
was
in
august

i
was
not

of
cours

refer
to
barbar
attack
upon
the
civil
popul

but
to
the
great
air
battl
which
is
be
fought
out
between
our
fighter
and
the
german
air
forc


you
will
understand
that
whenev
the

is

wave
of

protect
by

often
three
or
four
hundr

surg

especi
the

of
kent

in
the
hope
of
attack
militari
and
other
object
by

howev

they
are
met
by
our

squadron
and
near
alway
broken
up

and
their
loss
averag
three

one
in

and
six
to

in

this
effort
of
the
german
to
secur
daylight
masteri
of
the
air
over
england
is

of
cours

the
crux
of
the
whole

so
far
it
has
fail
conspicu

it
has
cost
them
veri
dear

and
we
have
felt
stronger

and
actual
are
relat
a
good
deal
stronger

than
when
the
hard
fight
began
in
juli

there
is
no
doubt
that
herr
hitler
is
use
up
his
fighter
forc
at
a
veri
high
rate

and
that
if
he
goe
on
for
mani
more
week
he
will
wear
down
and
ruin
this
vital
part
of
his
air
forc

that
will
give
us
a
veri
great
advantag


on
the
other
hand

for
him
to
tri
to
invad
this
countri
without
have
secur
masteri
in

would
be

undertak

nevertheless

all

await

set
out
on

and
uncertain
voyag
across

we
cannot
tell
when
they
will
tri
to

we
cannot
be
sure
that
in
fact
they
will
tri
at

but
no

should
blind
himself
to
the
fact
that
a
heavi

full

invas
of

is
be
prepar

thorough

and
that

upon

or
upon

if

it

not

besid
this

it

therefor

we
must
regard
the
next
week
or
so
as
a
veri
import
period
in
our

it
rank
with
the
day
when
the
spanish

was
approach

and
drake
was
finish
his
game
of
bowl

or
when
nelson
stood
between

and

s
grand

at

we
have
read
all
about
this
in
the
histori
book

but
what
is
happen
now
is
on
a
far
greater
scale
and
of
far
more
consequ
to
the
life
and
futur
of

and
it
civilis
than
these
brave
old
day
of

everi
man
and

will
therefor
prepar
himself
to
do
his

whatev
it
may
be

with

our

our

forc
is
at
the

it
has
ever

and
it
is
conscious

not

our

a

that

rather
draw
from

the

and
of
a

won
not

a

that

of

who

dure
the

was

the
fierc

controversi
which
hung
around
him
in

were
hush
by
the

of
his
ill

are
silenc
by
his

in
pay
a
tribut
of
respect
and
of

to
an

who
has
been

no

oblig
to

the

which

which
have

but
at
the
lychgat
we
may
all
pass
our

our

judgment
under
a
search
review

it
is
not

for

in

phase
men
seem
to
have
been

in

they
seem
to
have
been

then
again

a
few
year
later

when
the

all

there
is

there

with

tri
to

to

it

and
kindl
with

the

of
former

what
is
the
worth
of
all
this

the
onli
guid
to
a

is
his
conscienc

the
onli
shield
to

is
the
rectitud
and
sincer
of
his
action

it
is
veri
imprud
to
walk
through

without
this
shield

becaus
we
are
so
often
mock
by
the
failur
of
our

and
the
upset
of

but
with
this
shield

howev
the
fate
may
play

we
march
alway
in
the
rank
of
honour


it
fell
to
nevill
chamberlain
in
one
of
the
suprem
crise
of
the

to
be
contradict
by
event

to
be
disappoint
in
his
hope

and
to
be
deceiv
and
cheat
by
a
wick

but
what
were
these
hope
in
which
he
was
disappoint

what
were
these
wish
in
which
he
was
frustrat

what
was
that
faith
that
was
abus

they
were
sure
among
the
most
nobl

of

the

the

the

the

even

utter

whatev
els
histori
may

about
these
terribl

tremend

we
can
be
sure
that
nevill

act
with
perfect
sincer
accord
to
his
light
and
strove
to
the
utmost
of
his
capac

which
were

to

from

this

as

the

it
is
also
a

even
at

we
were
guiltless

lie
befor

but
at

we
enter
upon

unit
and
with
clean
heart


i
do
not
propos
to
give
an
appreci
of
nevill
chamberlain
s
life
and
charact

but
there
were
certain
qualiti
alway
admir
in
these
island
which
he
possess
in
an
altogeth
except
degre

he
had
a
physic
and
moral
tough
of
fibr
which
enabl
him
all
through
his
vari
career
to
endur
misfortun
and
disappoint
without
be
unduli
discourag
or
weari

he
had
a
precis
of
mind
and
an
aptitud
for
busi
which
rais
him
far
abov
the
ordinari
level
of
our
generat

he
had
a
firm
of
spirit
which
was
not
often
elat
by
success

seldom
downcast
by
failur

and
never
sway
by
panic

when

contrari
to
all
his
hope

belief
and
exert

the
war
came
upon
him

and
when

as
he
himself
said

all
that
he
had
work
for
was
shatter

there
was
no
man
more
resolv
to
pursu
the
unsought
quarrel
to
the
death

the
same
qualiti
which
made
him
one
of
the
last
to
enter
the
war

made
him
one
of
the
last
who
would
quit
it
befor
the
full
victori
of
a
righteous
caus
was
won


i
had
the
singular
experi
of
pass
in
a
day
from
be
one
of
his
most
promin
oppon
and
critic
to
be
one
of
his
princip
lieuten

and
on
anoth
day
of
pass
from
serv
under
him
to
becom
the
head
of
a
govern
of
which

with
perfect
loyalti

he
was
content
to
be
a
member

such
relationship
are
unusu
in
our
public
life

i
have
befor
told
the
hous
how
on
the
morrow
of
the
debat
which
in
the
earli
day
of
may
challeng
his
posit

he
declar
to
me
and
a
few
other
friend
that
onli
a
nation
govern
could
face
the
storm
about
to
break
upon
us

and
that
if
he
were
an
obstacl
to
the
format
of
such
a
govern

he
would
instant
retir

thereaft

he
act
with
that
singl
of
purpos
and
simplic
of
conduct
which
at
all
time

and
especi
in
great
time

ought
to
be
the
ideal
of
us
all


when
he
return
to
duti
a
few
week
after
a
most
sever
oper

the
bombard
of
london
and
of
the
seat
of
govern
had
begun

i
was
a
wit
dure
that
fortnight
of
his
fortitud
under
the
most
grievous
and
pain
bodili
afflict

and
i
can
testifi
that

although
physic
onli
the
wreck
of
a
man

his
nerv
was
unshaken
and
his
remark
mental
faculti
unimpair


after
he
left
the
govern
he
refus
all
honour

he
would
die
like
his
father

plain
mr

chamberlain

i
sought
permiss
of
the
king

howev

to
have
him
suppli
with
the
cabinet
paper

and
until
a
few
day
of
his
death
he
follow
our
affair
with
keen

interest
and
tenac

he
met
the
approach
of
death
with
a
steadi
eye

if
he
griev
at
all

it
was
that
he
could
not
be
a
spectat
of
our
victori

but
i
think
he
die
with
the
comfort
of
know
that
his
countri
had

at
least

turn
the
corner


at
this
time
our
thought
must
pass
to
the
gracious
and
charm
ladi
who
share
his
day
of
triumph
and
advers
with
a
courag
and
qualiti
the

he
was

like
his

and
his

austen
befor
him

a
famous
member
of

of

and
we
here
assembl
this

member
of
all
parti

without
a
singl
except

feel
that
we
do
ourselv
and
our
countri
honour
in
salut
the
memori
of
one
whom
disra
would
have
call
an

english
worthi


dure
the
last

the
british
navi

in
addit
to
blockad
what
is
left
of
the
german
fleet
and
chase
the

has
had
impos
upon

the
sad
duti
of
put
effectu
out
of

for
the

of

the
capit
ship
of
the
french
navi

these

under
the
armistic
term

sign
in
the
railway
coach
at
compiegn

would
have
been
place
within
the
power
of
nazi
germani

the
transfer
of
these
ship
to
hitler
would
have
endang
the
secur
of
both
great
britain
and
the
unite
state

we
therefor
had
no
choic
but
to
act
as
we
did

and
to
act
forthwith

our
pain
task
is
now
complet

although
the
unfinish
battleship

the
jean
bart

still
rest
in
a
moroccan
harbor
and
there
are
a
number
of
french
warship
at

and
in
various
french

all
over
the

these
are
not
in
a

of

to
derang
our
preponder
of
naval
power

as
long

therefor

as
they
make
no
attempt
to
return
to

control
by
germani
or

we
shall
not
molest
them
in
ani

that
melancholi
phase
in
our
relat

has

so
far
as
we
are

come
to
an

let
us
think
rather
of
the

today

the
fourteenth

the

a

in

to

and
comfort
us
when
we
stand
in

befor
the

scroll
of
human

and
i
proclaim
my
faith
that
some
of
us
will
live
to
see
a
fourteenth
of

when
a
liber
franc
will
onc
again
rejoic
in
her
great

in
her
glori

and
onc
again
stand
forward
as
the
champion
of
the
freedom
and
the
right
of
man

when
the
day
dawn

as
dawn
it
will

the
soul
of
franc
will
turn
with
comprehens
and
with
kind
to
those
frenchmen
and
frenchwomen

wherev
they
may
be

who
in
the
darkest
hour
did
not
despair
of
the
republ


in
the
meantim

we
shall
not
wast
our
breath
nor
cumber
our
thought
with
reproach

when
you
have
a
friend
and
comrad
at
whose
side
you
have
face
tremend
struggl

and
your
friend
is
smitten
down
by
a
stun
blow

it
may
be
necessari
to
make
sure
that
the
weapon
that
has
fallen
from
his
hand
shall
not
be
ad
to
the
resourc
of

but
you
need
not
bear
malic
becaus
of
your

you

remain

so
long

we

subject
to
the
iron
demand
of
the

which
we
are

we

at

way
we
carri

that

all

one

is
certain

the

nor
will
the

yield
itself
to

now
it

unravish
countri
of
europ

who
cannot
measur
our
resourc
or
our
resolv

may
have
fear
for
our
surviv
when
they
saw
so
mani
state
and
kingdom
torn
to
piec
in
a
few
week
or
even
day
by
the
monstrous
forc
of
the
nazi
war
machin

but
hitler
has
not
yet
been
withstood
by
a
great
nation
with
a
will
power
the
equal
of
his
own

mani
of
these
countri
have
been
poison
by
intrigu
befor
they
were
struck
down
by
violenc

they
have
been
rot
from
within
befor
they
were
smitten
from
without

how
els
can
you
explain
what
has
happen
to
franc

to
the
french
armi

to
the
french
peopl

to
the
leader
of
the
french
peopl


but
here

in
our
island

we
are
in
good
health
and
in
good
heart

we
have
seen
how
hitler
prepar
in
scientif
detail
the
plan
for
destroy
the
neighbor
countri

of
germani

he
had
his
plan
for
poland
and
his
plan
for
norway

he
had
his
plan
for
denmark

he
had
his
plan
all
work
out
for
the
doom
of
the
peac

trust
dutch

and

of
cours

for
the
belgian

we
have
seen
how
the
french
were
undermin
and
overthrown

we
may
therefor
be
sure
that
there
is
a
plan
perhap
built
up
over
year
for
destroy
great
britain

which
after
all
has
the
honor
to
be
his
main
and
foremost
enemi

all
i
can
say
is
that
ani
plan
for
invad
britain
which
hitler
made
two
month
ago
must
have
had
to
be
entir
recast
in
order
to
meet
our
new
posit

two
month
ago
nay

one
month
ago
our
first
and
main
effort
was
to
keep
our
best
armi
in
franc

all
our
regular
troop

all
our
output
of
munit

and
a
veri
larg
part
of
our
air
forc

had
to
be
sent
to
franc
and
maintain
in
action
there

but
now
we
have
it
all
at
home

never
befor
in
the
last
war
or
in
this
have
we
had
in
this
island
an
armi
compar
in
qualiti

equip
or
number
to
that
which
stand
here
on

tonight

we
have
a
million
and
a
half
men
in
the
british
armi
under
arm
tonight

and
everi
week
of
june
and
juli
has
seen
their

their

advanc
by

no

is
too
high
for
the

and
civilian
who
have
made
this
immens
transform
in
so
short
a

behind

as
a

for

born

and
ani

that
may
be
found
in

but
i
do
not
believ
there
are
mani
woe
betid
them

they
will
get
short
shrift

behind
the
regular

we
have
more
than
a

of
the
local

volunt

or

as
they
are
much
better
call

the

home
guard


these
offic
and

a
larg
proport
of
whom
have
been
through
the
last

have
the
strongest
desir
to
attack
and
come
to
close
quarter
with
the
enemi
wherev
he
may
appear

should
the
invad
come
to
britain

there
will
be
no
placid
lie
down
of
the
peopl
in

befor
him

as
we
have
seen

ala

in

we
shall
defend
everi

everi

everi

the
vast
mass
of
london
itself

fought
street
by

could
easili
devour

and
we
would
rather
see
london
laid
in
ruin
and
ash
than
that
it
should
be
tame
and
abject
enslav

i
am
bound
to
state
these
fact

becaus
it
is
necessari
to
inform
our
peopl
of
our
intent

and
thus
to
reassur
them


this
has
been
a
great
week
for
the
royal
air
forc

and
for
the
fighter
command

they
have
shot
down
more
than
five
to
one
of
the
german
aircraft
which
have
tri
to
molest
our
convoy
in
the
channel

or
have
ventur
to
cross
the
british
coast
line

these
are

of
cours

onli
the
preliminari
encount
to
the
great
air
battl
which
lie
ahead

but
i
know
of
no
reason
whi
we
should
be
discont
with
the
result
so
far
achiev

although

of
cours

we
hope
to
improv
upon
them
as
the
fight
becom
more
widespread
and
come
more
inland

around
all
lie
the
power
of
the
royal
navi

with
over
a
thousand

ship
under
the
white

the

the

which
is
capabl
of
transfer
it
forc

of

capabl
also
of
keep
open
communic
with
the
new

from
whom

as
the
struggl
deepen

increas

will
come

is
it
not
remark
that
after
ten
month
of
unlimit
u
boat
and
air
attack
upon
our
commerc

our
food
reserv
are
higher
than
they
have

we

apart
from
great

of

than
we
had
at

these
must

for

not

for

but
for
1942

when
the

will

i
trust

take
a
differ
form
from
the

in

it
has
hitherto

i
dwell
on
these
element
in
our
strength

on
these
resourc
which
we
have

i
dwell
on
them
becaus
it
is
right
to
show
that
the

can
command
the

of

and
that
while

toil

had
everi
need
to
do
so
and
although
he
had
made
vast
prepar

baffl
in
this
mighti
project

he
sought
to
break
the
spirit
of
the
british
nation
by
the
bomb

first
of
london

and
afterward
of
our
great
citi

it
has
now
been
prove

to
the
admir
of
the
world

and
of
our
friend
in
the
unite
state

that
this
form
of
blackmail
by
murder
and
terror

so
far
from
weaken
the
spirit
of
the
british
nation

has
onli
rous
it
to
a
more
intens
and
univers
flame
than
was
ever
seen
befor
in
ani
modern
communiti


the
whole
british
empire
has
been
proud
of
the
mother
countri

and
they
long
to
be
with
us
over
here
in
even
larger
number

we
have
been
deepli
conscious
of
the
love
for
us
which
has
flow
from
the
dominion
of
the
crown
across
the
broad
ocean
space

there
is
the
first
of
our
war
aim

to
be
worthi
of
that
love

and
to
preserv
it


all
through
these
dark
winter
month
the
enemi
has
had
the
power
to
drop
three
or
four
ton
of
bomb
upon
us
for
everi
ton
we
could
send
to
germani
in
return

we
are
arrang
so
that
present
this
will
be
rather
the
other
way
round

but

meanwhil

london
and
our
big
citi
have
had
to
stand
their
pound

they
remind
me
of
the
british
squar
at
waterloo

they
are
not
squar
of
soldier

they
do
not
wear
scarlet
coat

they
are
just
ordinari
english

scottish

and
welsh
folk

men

women

and
children

stand
steadfast
togeth

but
their
spirit
is
the

their
glori
is
the
same

and

in
the
end

their
victori
will
be
greater
than
far
fame
waterloo


more
than
two
third
of
the

has
now
gone

and
so
far
we
have
had
no
serious
epidem

inde

there
is
no
increas
of

in

of
the

condit
of

that
is

credit
to

author

to

there
is
anoth
thing
which
surpris
me
when
i
ask
about
it

in
spite
of
all
these
new
war
time
offens
and
prosecut
of
all
kind

in
spite
of
all
the
opportun
for
loot
and
disord

there
has
been
less
crime
this
winter
and
there
are
now
fewer
prison
in
our
jail
than
in
the
year
of
peac

we
have
broken
the
back
of
the
winter

the
daylight
grow

the
royal
air
forc
grow

and
is
alreadi
certain
master
of
the
daylight
air

the
attack
may
be
sharper

but
they
will
be
shorter

there
will
be
more
opportun
for
work
and
servic
of
all
kind

more
opportun
for
life

so

if
our
first
victori
was
the
repuls
of
the

our

was
the
frustrat
of

of

tell
the
truth
about
what
they
have
seen
over
here

and
more
than
that
we
do
not
ask

the
rest
we
leav
with
good
confid
to
the
judgment
of
the
presid
the
congress
and
the
peopl
of
the
unite
state


i
have
been
so
veri
care

sinc
i
have
been
prime
minist

not
to
encourag
fals
hope
or
prophesi
smooth
and
easi
thing

and
yet
the
tale
that
i
have
to
tell
today
is
one
which
must
just
and
right
give
us
caus
for
deep
thank

and
also

i
think

for
strong
comfort
and
even
rejoic

but
now
i
must
dwell
upon
the
more
serious

darker
and
more
danger
aspect
of
the
vast
scene
of
the
war

we
must
all
of
us
have
been
ask
ourselv

what
has
that
wick
man
whose
crime
stain
regim
and
system
are
at
bay
and
in
the
toil
what
has
he
been
prepar
dure
these
winter
month

what
new
devilri
is
he
plan

what
new
small
countri
will
he
overrun
or
strike
down

what
fresh
form
of
assault
will
he
make
upon
our
island
home
and
fortress

which

let
there
be
no
mistak
about
it

is
all
that
stand
between
him
and
the
dominion
of
the
world


we
may
be
sure
that
the
war
is
soon
go
to
enter
upon
a
phase
of
greater
violenc




we
saw
what
happen
last
may
in
the
low
countri

how
they
hope
for
the
best

how
they
clung
to
their
neutral

how
woefulli
they
were
deceiv

overwhelm

plunder

enslav
and
sinc
starv

we
know
how
we
and
the
french
suffer
when

at
the
last
moment

at
the
urgent
belat
appeal
of
the
king
of
the
belgian

we
went
to
his
aid

of
cours

if
all
the
balkan
peopl
stood
togeth
and
act
togeth

aid
by
britain
and
turkey

it
would
be
mani
month
befor
a
german
armi
and
air
forc
of
suffici
strength
to
overcom
them
could
be
assembl
in
the
southeast
of
europ

and
in
those
month
much
might
happen

much
will
certain
happen
as
american
aid
becom
effect

as
our
air
power
grow

as
we
becom
a
well
arm
nation

and
as
our
armi
in
the
east
increas
in
strength

but
noth
is
more
certain
than
that

if
the
countri
of
southeastern
europ
allow
themselv
to
be
pull
to
piec
one
by
one

they
will
share
the
fate
of
denmark

holland

and
belgium

and
none
can
tell
how
long
it
will
be
befor
the
hour
of
their
deliver
strike


one
of
our
difficulti
is
to
convinc
some
of
these
neutral
countri
in
europ
that
we
are
go
to
win

we
think
it
astonish
that
they
should
be
so
dens
as
not
to
see
it
as
clear
as
we
do
ourselv


but
after
all

the
fate
of
this
war
is
go
to
be
settl
by
what
happen
on
the
ocean

in
the
air

and
abov
all
in
this
island

it
seem
now
to
be
certain
that
the
govern
and
peopl
of
the
unite
state
intend
to
suppli
us
with
all
that
is
necessari
for
victori

in
the
last
war
the
unite
state
sent
two
million
men
across
the
atlantic

but
this
is
not
a
war
of
vast
armi

fire
immens
mass
of
shell
at
one
anoth

we
do
not
need
the
gallant
armi
which
are
form
throughout
the
american
union

we
do
not
need
them
this
year

nor
next
year

nor
ani
year
that
i
can
forese

but
we
do
need
most
urgent
an
immens
and
continu
suppli
of
war
materi
and
technic
apparatus
of
all
kind

we
need
them
here
and
we
need
to
bring
them
here

we
shall
need
a
great
mass
of
ship
in
1942

far
more
than
we
can
build
ourselv

if
we
are
to
maintain
and
augment
our
war
effort
in
the
west
and
in
the
east


these
fact
are

of
cours

all
well
known
to
the
enemi

and
we
must
therefor
expect
that
herr
hitler
will
do
his
utmost
to
prey
upon
our
ship
and
to
reduc
the
volum
of
american
suppli
enter
these
island

have
conquer
franc
and
norway

his
clutch
finger
reach
out
on
both
side
of
us
into
the
ocean

i
have
never
underr
this
danger

and
you
know
i
have
never
conceal
it
from
you

therefor

i
hope
you
will
believ
me
when
i
say
that
1
have
complet
confid
in
the
royal
navi

aid
by
the
air
forc
of
the
coastal
command

and
that
in
one
way
or
anoth
i
am
sure
they
will
be
abl
to
meet
everi
chang
phase
of
this
truli
mortal
struggl

and
that
sustain
by
the
courag
of
our
merchant
seamen

and
of
the
docker
and
workmen
of
all
our
port

we
shall
outwit

outmaneuv

outfight
and
outlast
the
worst
that
the
enemi
s
malic
and
ingenu
can
contriv


i
have
left
the
greatest
issu
to
the
end

you
will
have
seen
that
sir
john
dill

our
princip
militari
advis

the
chief
of
the
imperial
gener
staff

has
warn
us
all
that
hitler
may
be
forc

by
the
strateg

econom
and
polit
stress
in
europ

to
tri
to
invad
these
island
in
the
near
futur

that
is
a
warn
which
no
one
should
disregard

natur

we
are
work
night
and
day
to
have
everyth
readi

of
cours

we
are
far
stronger
than
we
ever
were
befor

incompar
stronger
than
we
were
in
juli

august
and
septemb

but
most
of
all
i
put
my
faith
in
the
simpl
unaffect
resolv
to
conquer
or
die
which
will
anim
and
inspir
near
four
million
briton
with
servic
weapon
in
their
hand


it
is
not
an
easi
militari
oper
to
invad
an
island
like
great
britain

without
the
command
of
the
sea
and
without
the
command
of
the
air

and
then
to
face
what
will
be
wait
for
the
invad
here

but
i
must
drop
one
word
of
caution

for

next
to
cowardic
and
treacheri

overconfid

lead
to
neglect
or
sloth

is
the
worst
of
martial
crime

therefor

i
drop
one
word
of
caution

a
nazi
invas
of
great
britain
last
autumn
would
have
been
a
more
or
less
improvis
affair

hitler
took
it
for
grant
that
when
franc
gave
in
we
should
give
in

but
we
did
not
give
in

and
he
had
to
think
again

an
invas
now
will
be
support
by
a
much
more
care
prepar
tackl
and
equip
of
land
craft
and
other
apparatus

all
of
which
will
have
been
plan
and
manufactur
in
the
winter
month

we
must
all
be
prepar
to
meet
gas
attack

parachut
attack

and
glider
attack

with
constanc

forethought

and
practic
skill


in
order
to
win
the
war
hitler
must
destroy
great
britain

he
may
carri
havoc
into
the
balkan
state

he
may
tear
great
provinc
out
of
russia

he
may
march
to
the
caspian

he
may
march
to
the
gate
of
india

all
this
will
avail
him
noth

it
may
spend
his
curs
more
wide
throughout
europ
and
asia

but
it
will
not
avert
his
doom

with
everi
month
that
pass
the
mani
proud
and
onc
happi
countri
he
is
now
hold
down
by
brute
forc
and
vile
intrigu
are
learn
to
hate
the
prussian
yoke
and
the
nazi
name
as
noth
has
ever
been
hate
so
fierc
and
so
wide
among
men
befor

and
all
the
time

master
of
the
sea
and
air

the
british
empire

nay

in
a
certain
sens

the
whole
english
speak
world

will
be
on
his
track

bear
with
them
the
sword
of
justic


the
other
day

presid
roosevelt
gave
his
oppon
in
the
late
presidenti
election

mr

wendel
willki

a
letter
of
introduct
to
me

and
in
it
he
wrote
out
a
vers

in
his
own
handwrit

from
longfellow

which
he
said


appli
to
you
peopl
as
it
doe
to

here
is
the
vers

strong
and
great

human
with
all
it
fear

with
all
the
hope
of
futur
year

is
hang
breathless
on
thi
fate


what
is
the
answer
that
i
shall
give

in
your
name

to
this
great
man

the
thrice
chosen
head
of
a
nation
of
a
hundr
and
thirti
million

here
is
the
answer
which
i
will
give
to
presid
roosevelt

put
your
confid
in
us

give
us
your
faith
and
your
bless

and

under
provid

all
will
be
well


we
shall
not
fail
or
falter

we
shall
not
weaken
or
tire

neither
the
sudden
shock
of
battl

nor
the
long
drawn
trial
of
vigil
and
exert
will
wear
us
down

give
us
the
tool

and
we
will
finish
the
job


i
have
taken
occas
to
speak
to
you
tonight
becaus
we
have
reach
one
of
the
climacter
of
the
war

in
the
first
of
these
intens
turn
point

a
year
ago

franc
fell
prostrat
under
the
german
hammer
and
we
had
to
face
the
storm
alon


the
second
was
when
the
royal
air
forc
beat
the
hun
raider
out
of
the
daylight
air
raid
and
thus
ward
off
the
nazi
invas
of
our
island
while
we
were
still
ill
arm
and
ill
prepar


the
third
turn
point
was
when
the
presid
and
congress
of
the
unite
state
pass
the
leas
and
lend
enact

devot
near
2
000
000
000
sterl
of
the
wealth
of
the
new
world
to
help
us
defend
our
liberti
and
their
own


those
were
the
three
climacter


the
fourth
is
now
upon
us


at
4
o
clock
this
morn
hitler
attack
and
invad
russia

all
his
usual
formal
of
perfidi
were
observ
with
scrupul
techniqu

a
non
aggress
treati
had
been
solemn
sign
and
was
in
forc
between
the
two
countri

no
complaint
had
been
made
by
germani
of
it
non
fulfil

under
it
cloak
of
fals
confid
the
german
armi
drew
up
in
immens
strength
along
a
line
which
stretch
from
the
white
sea
to
the
black
sea
and
their
air
fleet
and
armour
divis
slowli
and
method
took
up
their
station


then

sudden

without
declar
of
war

without
even
an
ultimatum

the
german
bomb
rain
down
from
the
sky
upon
the
russian
citi

the
german
troop
violat
the
russian
frontier
and
an
hour
later
the
german
ambassador

who
till
the
night
befor
was
lavish
his
assur
of
friendship

almost
of
allianc

upon
the
russian

call
upon
the
russian
foreign
minist
to
tell
him
that
a
state
of
war
exist
between
germani
and
russia


thus
was
repeat
on
a
far
larger
scale
the
same
kind
of
outrag
against
everi
form
of
sign
compact
and
intern
faith
which
we
have
wit
in
norway

in
denmark

in
holland

in
belgium
and
which
hitler
s
accomplic
and
jackal

mussolini

so
faith
imit
in
the
case
of
greec


all
this
was
no
surpris
to
me

in
fact
i
gave
clear
and
precis
warn
to
stalin
of
what
was
come

i
gave
him
warn

as
i
have
given
warn
to
other
befor

i
can
onli
hope
that
these
warn
did
not
fall
unheed


all
we
know
at
present
is
that
the
russian
peopl
are
defend
their
nativ
soil
and
that
their
leader
have
call
upon
them
to
resist
to
the
utmost


hitler
is
a
monster
of
wicked

insati
in
his
lust
for
blood
and
plunder

not
content
with
have
all
europ
under
his
heel
or
els
terror
into
various
form
of
abject
submiss

he
must
now
carri
his
work
of
butcheri
and
desol
among
the
vast
multitud
of
russia
and
of
asia

the
terribl
militari
machin
which
we
and
the
rest
of
the
civil
world
so
foolish

so
supin

so
insens
allow
the
nazi
gangster
to
build
up
year
by
year
from
almost
noth
this
machin
cannot
stand
idl

lest
it
rust
or
fall
to
piec

it
must
be
in
continu
motion

grind
up
human
live
and
trampl
down
the
home
and
the
right
of
hundr
of
million
of
men


moreov

it
must
be
fed
not
onli
with
flesh
but
with
oil

so
now
this
bloodthirsti
guttersnip
must
launch
his
mechan
armi
upon
new
field
of
slaughter

pillag
and
devast

poor
as
are
the
russian
peasant

workmen
and
soldier

he
must
steal
from
them
their
daili
bread

he
must
devour
their
harvest

he
must
rob
them
of
the
oil
which
drive
their
plough
and
thus
produc
a
famin
without
exampl
in
human
histori


and
even
the
carnag
and
ruin
which
his
victori

should
he
gain
it
though
he
s
not
gain
it
yet
will
bring
upon
the
russian
peopl

will
itself
be
onli
a
step
stone
to
the
attempt
to
plung
four
or
five
hundr
million
who
live
in
china
and
the
350
000
000
who
live
in
india
into
that
bottomless
pit
of
human
degrad
over
which
the
diabol
emblem
of
the
swastika
flaunt
itself


it
is
not
too
much
to
say
here
this
pleasant
summer
even
that
the
live
and
happi
of
a
thousand
million
addit
human
be
are
now
menac
with
brutal
nazi
violenc

that
is
enough
to
make
us
hold
our
breath


but
present
i
shall
show
you
someth
els
that
lie
behind
and
someth
that
touch
veri
near
the
life
of
britain
and
of
the
unite
state


the
nazi
regim
is
indistinguish
from
the
worst
featur
of
commun

it
is
devoid
of
all
theme
and
principl
except
appetit
and
racial
domin

it
excel
in
all
form
of
human
wicked

in
the
effici
of
it
cruelti
and
feroci
aggress

noon
has
been
a
more
consist
oppon
of
commun
than
i
have
for
the
last
twenti
five
year

i
will
unsay
no
word
that
i
ve
spoken
about
it

but
all
this
fade
away
befor
the
spectacl
which
is
now
unfold


the
past

with
it
crime

it
folli
and
it
tragedi

flash
away

i
see
the
russian
soldier
stand
on
the
threshold
of
their
nativ
land

guard
the
field
which
their
father
have
till
from
time
immemori

i
see
them
guard
their
home

their
mother
and
wive
pray

ah
yes

for
there
are
time
when
all
pray
for
the
safeti
of
their
love
one

for
the
return
of
the
breadwinn

of
the
champion

of
their
protector


i
see
the
10
000
villag
of
russia

where
the
mean
of
exist
was
wrung
so
hard
from
the
soil

but
where
there
are
still
primordi
human
joy

where
maiden
laugh
and
children
play
i
see
advanc
upon
all
this

in
hideous
onslaught

the
nazi
war
machin

with
it
clank

heel
click

dandifi
prussian
offic

it
crafti
expert
agent

fresh
from
the
cow
and
tie
down
of
a
dozen
countri

i
see
also
the
dull

drill

docil
brutish
mass
of
the
hun
soldieri

plod
on
like
a
swarm
of
crawl
locust

i
see
the
german
bomber
and
fighter
in
the
sky

still
smart
from
mani
a
british
whip

so
delight
to
find
what
they
believ
is
an
easier
and
a
safer
prey

and
behind
all
this
glare

behind
all
this
storm

i
see
that
small
group
of
villain
men
who
plan

organ
and
launch
this
cataract
of
horror
upon
mankind


and
then
my
mind
goe
back
across
the
year
to
the
day
when
the
russian
armi
were
our
alli
against
the
same
dead
foe
when
they
fought
with
so
much
valor
and
constanc
and
help
to
gain
a
victori

from
all
share
in
which

ala

they
were

through
no
fault
of
our

utter
cut
off


i
have
live
through
all
this
and
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
express
my
feel
and
the
stir
of
old
memori

but
now
i
have
to
declar
the
decis
of
his
majesti
s
govern

and
i
feel
sure
it
is
a
decis
in
which
the
great
dominion
will

in
due
cours

concur

and
that
we
must
speak
of
now

at
onc

without
a
day
s
delay

i
have
to
make
the
declar

but
can
you
doubt
what
our
polici
will
be


we
have
but
one
aim
and
one
singl

a

it

but
this
is
onli
a
begin

from
now
henceforward
the
main
expans
of
our

forc
proceed
with
gather
speed

in
anoth
six
month
the
weight
of
the
help
we
are
receiv
from
the
unite
state
in
war
materi
of
all
kind

especi
in
heavi
bomber

will
begin
to
tell

this
is
no
class
war

it
is
a
war
in
which
the
whole
british
empire
and
commonwealth
of
nation
is
engag
without
distinct
of
race

creed
or
parti


it
is
not
for
me
to
speak
of
the
action
of
the
unite
state

but
this
i
will
say

if
hitler
imagin
that
his
attack
on
soviet
russia
will
caus
the
slightest
divis
of
aim
or
slacken
of
effort
in
the
great
democraci

who
are
resolv
upon
his
doom

he
is
woefulli
mistaken

on
the
contrari

we
shall
be
fortifi
and
encourag
in
our
effort
to
rescu
mankind
from
his
tyranni

we
shall
be
strengthen
and
not
weaken
in
our
determin
and
in
our
resourc


this
is
no
time
to
moral
upon
the
folli
of
countri
and
govern
which
have
allow
themselv
to
be
struck
down
one
by
one
when
by
unit
action
they
could
so
easili
have
save
themselv
and
save
the
world
from
this
catastroph


but

when
i
spoke
a
few
minut
ago
of
hitler
s
bloodlust
and
the
hate
appetit
which
have
impel
or
lure
him
on
his
russian
adventur

i
said
there
was
one
deeper
motiv
behind
his
outrag

he
wish
to
destroy
the
russian
power
becaus
he
hope
that
if
he
succeed
in
this
he
will
be
abl
to
bring
back
the
main
strength
of
his
armi
and
air
forc
from
the
east
and
hurl
it
upon
this
island

which
he
know
he
must
conquer
or
suffer
the
penalti
of
his
crime


his
invas
of
russia
is
no
more
than
a
prelud
to
an
attempt
invas
of
the
british
isles

he
hope

no
doubt

that
all
this
may
be
accomplish
befor
the
winter
come
and
that
he
can
overwhelm
great
britain
befor
the
fleet
and
air
power
of
the
unite
state
will
interven

he
hope
that
he
may
onc
again
repeat
upon
a
greater
scale
than
ever
befor
that
process
of
destroy
his
enemi
one
by
one

by
which
he
has
so
long
thrive
and
prosper

and
that
then
the
scene
will
be
clear
for
the
final
act

without
which
all
his
conquest
would
be
in
vain

name

the
subjug
of
the
western
hemispher
to
his
will
and
to
his
system


the
russian
danger
is
therefor
our
danger
and
the
danger
of
the
unite
state
just
as
the
caus
of
ani
russian
fight
for
his
hearth
and
home
is
the
caus
of
free
men
and
free
peopl
in
everi
quarter
of
the
globe


let
us
learn
the
lesson
alreadi
taught
by
such
cruel
experi

let
us
redoubl
our
exert
and
strike
with
unit
strength
while
life
and
power
remain


am
veri
glad
to
come
here
to
day
to
pay
my
tribut
and
to
record
in
the
name
of
the
govern
our
gratitud
to
all
the
civil
author
of
london
who

first
under
sir
john
anderson

and
through
the
darkest
moment
under
the
courag
and
resourc
leadership
of
mr

herbert
morrison
so
long
master
of
the
london
counti
council

and
now
act
in
an
even
higher
sphere
to
all
who
carri
out
their
duti
faith

skil

and
devot

so
that
at
last
we
made
our
way
through
the

tempest

and
came
for
the
time
be

at
ani
rate

into
a
calm
spell


dure
her
long
ordeal
london
was
upheld
by
the
sympathi
and
admir
of
the
other
great
citi
of
our
island
and
let
us
not
forget
here
loyal
belfast

in
northern
ireland
and
when
after
the
enemyweari
of
his
attack
upon
the
capit
and
turn
to
other
part
of
the
countri

mani
of
us
in
our
heart
felt
anxieti
lest
the
weight
of
attack
concentr
on
those
smaller
organ
should
prove
more
effect
than
when
direct
on
london

which
is
so
vast
and
strong
that
she
is
like
a
prehistor
monster
into
whose
armour
hide
shower
of
arrow
can
be
shot
in
vain

but
a
fright
measur
of
cruelti
of
the
enemi
s
assault

and
i
say
here
that

while
we
are
entitl
to
speak
particular
of
london

we
honour
them
for
their
constanc
in
a
comradeship
of
suffer

of
endur

and
of
triumph

that
comradeship
in
this
hideous

unpreced

novel
pressur
has
unit
us
all

and
it
has
prove
to
the
world
the
qualiti
of
our
island
life


i
have
no
doubt
whatev

as
i
said
to
the
civil
defenc
forc
in
hyde
park
this
morn

that
the
behaviour
of
the
british
peopl
in
this
trial
gain
them
conquest
in
the
mind
and
spirit
and
sympathi
of
the
unite
state
of
america
which
swept
into
an
igdomini
comer
all
the
vilest
strokesof
goebbel
propaganda


we
have
to
ask
ourselv
this
question

will
the
bomb
attack
of
last
autumn
and
winter
come
back
again

we
have
proceed
on
the
assumpt
that
they
will

some
month
ago
i
request
the
home
secretari
and
minist
of
home
secur
and
his
princip
colleagu

the
minist
of
health
and
other

to
make
everi
prepar
for
the
autumn
and
winter
war
as
if
we
should
have
to
go
through
the
same
ordeal
as
last
year

onli
rather
wors

i
am
sure
that
everyth
is
be
done
in
accord
with
those
direct

the
shelter
are
be
strengthen

improv

light
and
warm

all
arrang
for
fire
control
and
fire
watch
are
be
improv

perpetu


mani
new
arrang
are
be
contriv
as
a
result
of
the
hard
experi
through
which
we
have
pass
and
the
mani
mistak
which
no
doubt
we
have
made
for
success
is
the
re

sult
of
make
mani
mistak
and
learn
from
experi

if
the
lull
is
to
end

if
the
storm
is
to
renew
itself

london
will
be
readi

london
will
not
flinch

london
can
take
it
again



we
ask
no
favour
of
the
enemi

we
seek
from
them
no
compunct

on
the
contrari

if
to
night
the
peopl
of
london
were
ask
to
cast
their
vote
whether
a
convent
should
be
enter
into
to
stop
the
bomb
of
all
citi

the
overwhelm
major
would
cri


no

we
will
mete
out
to
the
german
the
measur

and
more
than
the
measur

that
they
have
mete
out
to
us


the
peopl
of
london
with
one
voic
would
say
to
hitler


you
have
commit
everi
crime
under
the
sun

where
you
have
been
the
least
resist
there
you
have
been
the
most
brutal

it
was
you
who
began
the
indiscrimin
bomb

we
rememb
warsaw
in
the
veri
first
few
day
of
the
war

we
rememb
rotterdam

we
have
been
newli
remind
of
your
habit
by
the
hideous
massacr
of
belgrad

we
know
too
well
the
bestial
as


sault
yon
are
make
upon
the
russian
peopl

to
whom
our
heart
go
out
in
their
valiant
struggl

we
will
have
no
truce
or
parley
with
you

or
the
grisli
gang
who
work
your
wick
will

you
do
your
worst
and
we
will
do
our
best


perhap
it
may
be
our
turn
soon

perhap
it
may
be
our
turn
now


we
live
in
a
terribl
epoch
of
the
human
stori

but
we
believ
there
is
a
broad
and
sure
justic
run
through
it
theme

it
is
time
that
the
german
should
be
made
to
safer
in
their
own
and
citi
someth
of
the
torment
they
have
twice
in
our
lifetim
let
loos
upon
their
neighbour
and
upon
the

world


we
have
now
intensifi
for
a
month
past
our
systemat

scientif

method
bomb
on
a
lazg
scale
of
the
german
citi

seaport

industri

and
other
militari
object

we
believ
it
to
be
in
our
power
to
keep
this
process
go

on
a
steadili
rise
tide

month
after
month

year
after
year

until

the
nazi
regim
is
either
extirp
by
us
or

better
still

torn
to
piec
by
the
german
peopl
themselv



everi
month
as
the
great
bomber
are
finish
in
our
factori
or
sweep
hither
across
the
atlantic
ocean
we
shall
continu
the
remorseless
discharg
of
high
explos
on
germani

everi
month
will
see
the
tonnag
increas

and

as
the
night
lengthen
and
the
rang
of
our
bomber
also
grow

that
unhappi

abject

subject
provinc
of
germani
which
use
to
be
call
itali
will
have
it
fair
share
too



in
the
last
few
week
alon
we
have
thrown
upon
germani
about
half
the
tonnag
of
bomb
thrown
by
the
german
upon
our
citi
dure
the
whole
cours
of
the
war

but
this
is
onli
the
begin

and
we
hope
by
next
juli
to
multipli
our
deliveri
manifold


it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
must
ask
you
to
be
prepar
for
vehement
counter
action
by
the
enemi

our
method
of
deal
with
the
german
night
raider
have
steadili
improv

they
no
longer
relish
their
trip

to
our
shore

it
is
not
true
to
say
they
did
not
come
this
last
moon
becaus
they
were
all
engag
in
russia

they
have
a
bomb
forc
in
the
west
quit
capabl
of
make
veri
heavi
attack

i
do
not
know
whi
they
did
not
come

but

as
i
mention
in
hyde
park

it
is
certain
not
becaus
they
have
begun
to
love
us
more

it
may
be
becaus
they
are
save

up

but
even
if
that
be
so

the
veri
fact
that
they
have
to
save
up
should
give
us
confid
by
reveal
the
truth
of
our
steadi
advanc
from
an
almost
unarm
posit
to
a
posit
at
least
of
equal

and
soon
of
superior
to
them
in
the
air


but
all
engag
in
our
civil
defenc
forc

whether
in
london
or
throughout
the
countri

must
prepar
themselv
for
further
heavi
assault

your

your

yoor
devot
to

your

for

we
do
not

hit
back

and
we
in

tend
with
everi

that

to

harder

prepar
yourselv

then

my

for
this

we
shall
never

howev
sombr

howev
grievous
the

becaus
we

will
be
born
a
new
freedom
and

for

when

sir



almost
a
year
has
pass
sinc
i
came
down
here
at
your
head
master
s
kind
invit
in
order
to
cheer
myself
and
cheer
the
heart
of
a
few
of
my
friend
by
sing
some
of
our
own
song

the
ten
month
that
have
pass
have
seen
veri
terribl
catastroph
event
in
the
world


up
and
down

misfortun


but
can
anyon
sit
here
this
afternoon

this
october
afternoon

not
feel
deepli
thank
for
what
has
happen
in
the
time
that
has
pass
and
for
the
veri
great
improv
in
the
posit
of
our
countri
and
of
our
home

whi

when
i
was
here
last
time
we
were
quit
alon

desper
alon

and
we
had
been
so
for
five
or
six
month

we
were
poor
arm

we
are
not
so
poor
arm
today

but
then
we
were
veri
poor
arm

we
had
the
unmeasur
menac
of
the
enemi
and
their
air
attack
still
beat
upon
us

and
you
yourselv
had
had
experi
of
this
attack

and
i
expect
you
are
begin
to
feel
impati
that
there
has
been
this
long
lull
with
noth
particular
turn
up


but
we
must
learn
to
be
equal
good
at
what
is
short
and
sharp
and
what
is
long
and
tough

it
is
general
said
that
the
british
are
often
better
at
the
last

they
do
not
expect
to
move
from
crisi
to
crisi

they
do
not
alway
expect
that
each
day
will
bring
up
some
nobl
chanc
of
war

but
when
they
veri
slowli
make
up
their
mind
that
the
thing
has
to
be
done
and
the
job
put
through
and
finish

then

even
if
it
take
month


if
it
take
year


they
do
it


another
lesson
i
think
we
may
take

just
throw
our
mind
back
to
our
meet
here
ten
month
ago
and
now

is
that
appear
are
often
veri
decept

and
as
kipl
well
say

we
must




meet
with
triumph
and
disast

and
treat
those
two
impostor
just
the
same



you
cannot
tell
from
appear
how
thing
will
go

sometim
imagin
make
thing
out
far
wors
than
they
are

yet
without
imagin
not
much
can
be
done

those
peopl
who
are
imagin
see
mani
more
danger
than
perhap
exist

certain
mani
more
than
will
happen

but
then
they
must
also
pray
to
be
given
that
extra
courag
to
carri
this
far
reach
imagin

but
for
everyon

sure

what
we
have
gone
through
in
this
period


i
am
address
myself
to
the
school


sure
from
this
period
of
ten
month
this
is
the
lesson

never
give
in

never
give
in

never

never

never

never
in
noth

great
or
small

larg
or
petti


never
give
in
except
to
convict
of
honour
and
good
sens

never
yield
to
forc

never
yield
to
the
appar
overwhelm
might
of
the
enemi

we
stood
all
alon
a
year
ago

and
to
mani
countri
it
seem
that
our
account
was
close

we
were
finish

this
part
of
the
histori
of
this
countri

were
gone
and
finish
and
liquid


veri
differ
is
the
mood
today

britain

other
nation
thought

had
drawn
a
spong
across
her
slate

but
instead
our
countri
stood
in
the
gap

there
was
no
flinch
and
no
thought
of
give
in

and
by
what
seem
almost
a
miracl
to
those
outsid
these
island

though
we
ourselv
never
doubt
it

we
now
find
ourselv
in
a
posit
where
i
say
that
we
can
be
sure
that
we
have
onli
to
persever
to
conquer


you
sang
here
a
vers
of
a
school
song

you
sang
that
extra
vers
written
in
my
honour

which
i
was
veri
great
compliment
by
and
which
you
have
repeat
today

but
there
is
one
word
in
it
i
want
to
alter


i
want
to
do
so
last
year

but
i
did
not
ventur
to

it
is
the
line


not
less
we
prais
in
darker
day



i
have
obtain
the
head
master
s
permiss
to
alter
darker
to
sterner


not
less
we
prais
in
sterner
day



do
not
let
us
speak
of
darker
day

let
us
speak
rather
of
sterner
day

these
are
not
dark
day

these
are
great
day


the
greatest
day
our
countri
has
ever
live

and
we
must
all
thank
god
that
we
have
been
allow

each
of
us
accord
to
our
station

to
play
a
part
in
make
these
day
memor
in
the
histori
of
our
race

i
spend
this
anniversari
and
festiv
far
from
my
countri

far
from
my
famili

yet
i
cannot
truth
say
that
i
feel
far
from
home

whether
it
be
the
tie
of
blood
on
my
mother
s
side

or
the
friendship
i
have
develop
here
over
mani
year
of
activ

or
the
command
sentiment
of
comradeship
in
the
common
caus
of
great
peopl
who
speak
the
same
languag

who
kneel
at
the
same
altar
and

to
a
veri
larg
extent

pursu
the

ideal

i
cannot
feel
myself
a
stranger
here
in

i
feel
a
sens

the

would
it
be

of

other
peopl

no
vulgar
ambit

no
morbid
lust
for

at

had
led
us
to
the
field

here

in
the
midst
of

rage
and

over
all

and

creep
nearer

and

in

a
happi

to
you
all

member
of

and
of
the

of

of

i
feel
great
honor
that
you
should
have
thus
invit
me
to
enter
the
unite
state
senat
chamber
and
address
the
repres
of
both
branch
of
congress

the
fact
that
my
american
forebear
have
for
so
mani
generat
play
their
part
in
the
life
of
the
unite
state

and
that
here
i
am

an
englishman

welcom
in
your
midst

make
this
experi
one
of
the
most
move
and
thrill
in
my
life

which
is
alreadi
long
and
has
not
been
entir
unev

i
wish
inde
that
my
mother

whose
memori
i
cherish

across
the
vale
of
year

could
have
been
here
to
see

by
the
way

i
cannot
help
reflect
that
if
my
father
had
been
american
and
my
mother
british
instead
of
the
other
way
around

i
might
have
got
here
on
my
own

in
that
case
this
would
not
have
been
the
first
time
you
would
have
heard
my
voic

in
that
case
i
should
not
have
need
ani
invit

but
if
i
had
it
is
hard
like
that
it
would
have
been
unanim

so
perhap
thing
are
better
as
they
are



i
may
confess

howev

that
i
do
not
feel
quit
like
a
fish
out
of
water
in
a
legisl
assembl
where
english
is
spoken

i
am
a
child
of
the
hous
of
common

i
was
brought
up
in
my
father
s
hous
to
believ
in
democraci


trust
the
peopl


that
was
his
messag

i
use
to
see
him
cheer
at
meet
and
in
the
street
by
crowd
of
workingmen
way
back
in
those
aristocrat
victorian
day
when
as
disra
said

the
world
was
for
the
few

and
for
the
veri
few



therefor
i
have
been
in
full
harmoni
all
my
life
with
the
tide
which
have
flow
on
both
side
of
the
atlantic
against
privileg
and
monopoli
and
i
have
steer
confid
toward
the
gettysburg
ideal
of
govern
of
the
peopl

by
the
peopl

for
the
peopl


i
owe
my
advanc
entir
to
the
hous
of
common

whose
servant
i
am

in
my
countri
as
in
your
public
men
are
proud
to
be
the
servant
of
the
state
and
would
be
asham
to
be
it
master

the
hous
of
common

if
they
thought
the
peopl
want
it

could

by
a
simpl
vote

remov
me
from
my
offic

but
i
am
not
worri
about
it
at
all


as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
sure
they
will
approv
veri
high
of
my
journey
here

for
which
i
obtain
the
king
s
permiss

in
order
to
meet
the
presid
of

and
to
arrang
with
him
for

for

of
the
high

of
the
arm

in
both
countri
which
are
indispens

the
success
prosecut
of

i
should
like
to
say
first
of
all
how
much
i
have
been
impress
and
encourag
by
the
breadth
of

which

i
have
had
access

anyon
who
did
not
understand
the

of

might
easili
have

with

startl

and

episod
of

after

the

most

the
greatest

the
greatest

in

japan

germani
and
itali
have
all
declar
and
are
make
war
upon
you

and
the
quarrel
is
open
which
can
onli
end
in
their
overthrow
or
your


but
here
in
washington
in
these
memor
day
i
have
found
an
olympian
fortitud
which

far
from

upon
complac

is
onli
the
mask
of
an

and
the
proof
of
a
sure

well

confid
in
the
final
outcom

we
in
britain
had
the
same
feel
in
our
darkest
day

we
too
were
sure
that
in
the
end
all
would
be
well


you
do
not

i
am
certain

underr
the
sever
of
the
ordeal
to
which
you
and
we
have
still
to
be
subject

the
forc
rang
against
us
are
enorm

they
are
bitter

they
are
ruthless

the
wick
men
and
their
faction

who
have
launch
their
peopl
on
the
path
of
war
and
conquest

know
that
they
will
be
call
to
terribl
account
if
they
cannot
beat
down
by
forc
of

the

they

they
will

they

they
will

it
is
quit
true
that
on
our

our
resourc
in

are
far
greater
than

but
onli
a
portion
of
your

are
as
yet
mobil

develop

and
we
both
of

have
much
to
learn
in
the
cruel
art

we
have
therefor
without

a
time
of

in

some

it

for
the
best
part
of
twenti
year
the
youth
of
britain
and
america
have
been
taught
that
war
was
evil

which
is
true

and
that
it
would
never
come
again

which
has
been
prove
fals

for
the
best
part
of
twenti
year

the
youth
of
germani

of
japan
and
itali

have
been
taught
that
aggress
war
is
the
noblest
duti
of
the
citizen
and
that
it
should
be
begun
as
soon
as
the
necessari
weapon
and
organ
have
been
made

we
have
perform
the
duti
and
task
of
peac

they
have
plot
and
plan
for
war

this
natur
has
place
us

in
britain

and
now
place
you
in
the
unite
state
at
a
disadvantag
which
onli
time

courag
and
untir
exert
can
correct


we
have
inde
to
be
thank
that
so
much
time
has
been
grant
to
us

if
germani
had
tri
to
invad
the
british
isles
after
the
french
collaps
in
june

1940

and
if
japan
had
declar
war
on
the
british
empire
and
the
unite
state
at
about
the
same
date

no
one
can
say
what
disast
and
agoni
might
not
have
been
our
lot

but
now

at
the
end
of
decemb

1941

our
transform
from
easi
go
peac
to
total
war
effici
has
made
veri
great
progress


the
broad
flow
of
munit
in
great
britain
has
alreadi
begun

immens
stride
have
been
made
in
the
convers
of
american
industri
to
militari
purpos

and
now
that
the
unite
state
is
at
war

it
is
possibl
for
order
to
be
given
everi
day
which
in
a
year
or
eighteen
month
henc
will
produc
result
in
war
power
beyond
anyth
which
has
been
seen
or
foreseen
in

provid
that
everi

is

that

of

state
provid
that
is
bent
unremit
to
the
simpl

suprem
task

i
think
it
would
be
reason
to
hope
that
the
end
of
1942
will
see
us
quit
definit
in
a
better
posit
than
we
are
now

and
that
the
year
1943
will
enabl
us
to
assum
the

upon
an

scale


some
peopl
may
be
startl
or
momentarili
depress
when

like
your

i
speak
of
a
long

a

our

would
rather
know
the
truth

somber
though
it
be

and
after
all

when
we
are
do
the
noblest
work
in

not
onli
defend
our

but
the
caus
of
freedom
in
everi

the
question
of
whether
deliver
come
in
1942
or
1943
or
1944

fall
into
it
proper
place
in
the
grand
proport
of
human
histori

sure
i
am
that
this
day

now

we
are
the
master
of
our
fate

that
the
task
which
has
been
set
us
is
not
abov
our

that
it
pang
and
toil
are
not
beyond
our

as
long
as
we
have

and
an

salvat

he

in

it

there
may

anoth
explan


we

for

the

at

in

they
must
now
know
that
the

are
mortal

when
we
look
at
the
resourc

when

it
becom

what

indeed

there

a

is
equal
to
all
the

decis
that
have
to
be
taken
in

the

and
the

and
the

up
are
all
proceed
with
much
less

veri
much
less
than
we

fight
is
in

at

point

we
captur
various

which
were
of

and
which
were
not
blown

there
is
even

proceed

all

a

first

give
no
indic
of
what
may
be
the
cours
of
the

in

becaus
the

will
now
probabl
endeavour
to
concentr
on
this

and
in
that
event
heavi
fight
will
soon
begin
and
will
continu

as
we

it

therefor

a

the

at

it

a
solemn

for

for

also
join
an

if
you
look

you

you

also
you
must
feel
anxieti
lest
you
fall
below
the

of

opportun

here
now

clear
and
shine
for
both
our

to
reject
it
or
ignor
it
or
fritter
it
away
will
bring
upon
us
all
the
long
reproach
of
the

it
is
necessari
that
constanc
of

persist
of
purpos

and
the
grand
simplic
of

shall
guid
and
rule
the
conduct
of
the
english
speak
peopl
in
peac
as
they
did
in

we
must

and
i
believ
we
shall

prove
ourselv
equal
to
this
sever
requir


when
american
militari
men
approach
some
serious
situat
they
are
wont
to
write
at
the
head
of
their
direct
the
word

over
all
strateg
concept


there
is
wisdom
in
this

as
it
lead
to
clariti
of
thought

what
then
is
the
over
all
strateg
concept
which
we
should
inscrib
today

it
is
noth
less
than
the
safeti
and
welfar

the
freedom
and
progress

of
all
the
home
and
famili
of
all
the
men
and
women
in
all
the
land

and
here
i
speak
particular
of
the
myriad
cottag
or
apart
home
where
the
wage
earner
strive
amid
the
accid
and
difficulti
of
life
to
guard
his
wife
and
children
from
privat
and
bring
the
famili
up
in
the
fear
of
the
lord

or
upon
ethic
concept
which
often
play
their
potent
part


to
give
secur
to
these
countless
home

they
must
be
shield
from
the
two
giant
maraud

war
and
tyranni

we
all
know
the
fright
disturb
in
which
the
ordinari
famili
is
plung
when
the
curs
of
war
swoop
down
upon
the
bread
winner
and
those
for
whom
he
work
and
contriv

the
aw
ruin
of
europ

with
all
it
vanish
glori

and
of
larg
part
of

glare
us
in
the

when
the

dissolv
over

the

humbl

are
confront
with

with
which
they
cannot

for
them
all
is
distort

all
is
broken

even

to

when
i
stand
here
this
quiet
afternoon
i
shudder
to
visual
what
is
actual
happen
to
million
now
and
what
is
go

happen
in

when
famin
stalk

none

the

our

task
and

is
to
guard
the

of
the

from
the
horror
and
miseri
of

we
are
all
agre

our

after
have
proclaim
their

over

and
comput
avail

alway
proceed
to
the
next

name

the
method

here
again
there
is
widespread
agreement

a
world
organ
has
alreadi
been
erect
for
the
prime
purpos
of
prevent
war

uno

the
successor
of
the
leagu
of
nation

with
the
decis
addit
of
the
unite
state
and
all
that
mean

is
alreadi
at
work

we
must
make
sure
that
it
work
is
fruit

that
it
is
a
realiti
and
not
a
sham

that
it
is
a
forc
for
action

and
not
mere
a
froth
of
word

that
it
is
a
true
templ
of
peac
in
which
the
shield
of
mani
nation
can
some
day
be
hung
up

and
not
mere
a
cockpit
in
a
tower
of
babel

befor
we
cast
away
the
solid
assur
of
nation
armament
for
self
preserv
we
must
be
certain
that
our
templ
is
built

not
upon
shift
sand
or
quagmir

but
upon
the
rock

anyon
can
see
with
his
eye
open
that
our
path
will
be
difficult
and
also
long

but
if
we
persever
togeth
as
we
did
in
the
two
world
war



though
not

ala

in
the
interv
between
them



i
cannot
doubt
that
we
shall
achiev
our
common
purpos
in
the
end


i
have

howev

a
definit
and
practic
propos
to
make
for
action

court
and
magistr
may
be
set
up
but
they
cannot
function
without
sheriff
and
constabl

the
unite
nation
organiz
must
immedi
begin
to
be
equip
with
an
intern
arm
forc

in
such
a
matter
we
can
onli
go
step
by
step

but
we
must
begin
now

i
propos
that
each
of
the
power
and
state
should
be
invit
to
deleg
a
certain
number
of
air
squadron
to
the
servic
of
the
world
organ

these
squadron
would
be
train
and
prepar
in
their
own
countri

but
would
move
around
in
rotat
from
one
countri
to
anoth

they
would
wear
the
uniform
of
their
own
countri
but
with
differ
badg

they
would
not
be
requir
to
act
against
their
own
nation

but
in
other
respect
they
would
be
direct
by
the
world
organ

this
might
be
start
on
a
modest
scale
and
would
grow
as
confid
grew

i
wish
to
see
this
done
after
the
first
world
war

and
i
devout
trust
it
may
be
done
forthwith


it
would
nevertheless
be
wrong
and
imprud
to
entrust
the
secret
knowledg
or
experi
of
the
atom
bomb

which
the
unite
state

great
britain

and
canada
now
share

to
the
world
organ

while
it
is
still
in
it
infanc

it
would
be
crimin
mad
to
cast
it
adrift
in
this
still
agit
and
un
unit
world

no
one
in
ani
countri
has
slept
less
well
in
their
bed
becaus
this
knowledg
and
the
method
and
the
raw
materi
to
appli
it

are
at
present
larg
retain
in
american
hand

i
do
not
believ
we
should
all
have
slept
so
sound
had
the
posit
been
revers
and
if
some
communist
or
neo
fascist
state
monopol
for
the
time
be
these
dread
agenc

the
fear
of
them
alon
might
easili
have
been
use
to
enforc
totalitarian
system
upon
the
free
democrat
world

with
consequ
appal
to
human
imagin

god
has
will
that
this
shall
not
be
and
we
have
at
least
a
breath
space
to
set
our
hous
in
order
befor
this
peril
has
to
be
encount

and
even
then

if
no
effort
is
spare

we
should
still
possess
so
formid
a
superior
as
to
impos
effect
deterr
upon
it
employ

or
threat
of
employ

by
other

ultimat

when
the
essenti
brotherhood
of
man
is
truli
embodi
and
express
in
a
world
organ
with
all
the
necessari
practic
safeguard
to
make
it
effect

these
power
would
natur
be
confid
to
that
world
organ


now
i
come
to
the
second
danger
of
these
two
maraud
which
threaten
the
cottag

the

and
the
ordinari

name

we
cannot
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
the
liberti
enjoy
by
individu
citizen
throughout
the
british

are
not
valid
in
a

of

some
of

in

enforc
upon

the

is
exercis
without

either
by

by

through

it

are
so
numer
to

forcibl
in

of

but
we
must
never

in

the
great
principl

which
are

let

i
have
now
state
the

great
danger
which
menac

war

i
have
not

spoken

which
are

but
if
the
danger
of

are
remov

there
is
no
doubt
that
scienc
and
co
oper
can
bring
in
the
next

year
to
the
world

certain
in
the
next
few
decad
newli
taught

of

an
expans
of

well
be
beyond
anyth
that
has
yet
occur
in

experi

now

at
this
sad
and
breathless
moment

we
are
plung
in
the
hunger
and
distress
which
are
the
aftermath
of
our
stupend
struggl

but
this
will
pass
and
may
pass
quick

and
there
is
no
reason
except
human
folli
or
sub
human
crime
which
should
deni
to
all
the
nation
the
inaugur
and
enjoy
of
an
age
of
plenti

i
have
often
use
word
which
i
learn
fifti
year
ago
from
a
great
irish
american
orat

a
friend
of
mine

mr

bourk
cockran


there
is
enough
for
all

the
earth
is
a
generous
mother

she
will
provid
in
plenti
abund
food
for
all
her
children
if
they
will
but
cultiv
her
soil
in
justic
and
in
peac


so
far
i
feel
that
we
are
in
full
agreement

now

while
still
pursu
the
method
of
realiz
our
overal
strateg
concept

i
come
to
the
crux
of
what
i
have
travel
here
to
say

neither
the
sure
prevent
of
war

nor
the
continu
rise
of
world
organ
will
be
gain
without
what
i
have
call
the
fratern
associ
of
the
english
speak
peopl

this
mean
a
special
relationship
between
the
british
commonwealth
and
empire
and
the
unite
state

this
is
no
time
for
general

and
i
will
ventur
to
be
precis

fratern
associ
requir
not
onli
the
grow
friendship
and
mutual
understand
between
our
two
vast
but
kindr
system
of
societi

but
the
continu
of
the
intim
relationship
between
our
militari
advis

lead
to
common
studi
of
potenti
danger

the
similar
of
weapon
and
manual
of
instruct

and
to
the
interchang
of
offic
and
cadet
at
technic
colleg

it
should
carri
with
it
the
continu
of
the
present
facil
for
mutual
secur
by
the
joint
use
of
all
naval
and
air
forc
base
in
the
possess
of
either
countri
all
over
the
world

this
would
perhap
doubl
the
mobil
of
the
american
navi
and
air
forc

it
would
great
expand
that
of
the
british
empire
forc
and
it
might
well
lead

if
and
as
the
world
calm
down

to
import
financi
save

alreadi
we
use
togeth
a
larg
number
of
island

more
may
well
be
entrust
to
our
joint
care
in
the
near
futur


the
unite
state
has
alreadi
a
perman
defens
agreement
with
the
dominion
of
canada

which
is
so
devot
attach
to
the
british
commonwealth
and
empire

this
agreement
is
more
effect
than
mani
of
those
which
have
often
been
made
under
formal
allianc

this
principl
should
be
extend
to
all
british
commonwealth
with
full
reciproc

thus

whatev
happen

and
thus
onli

shall
we
be
secur
ourselv
and
abl
to
work
togeth
for
the
high
and
simpl
caus
that
are
dear
to
us
and
bode
no
ill
to
ani

eventual
there
may
come



i
feel
eventu
there
will
come



the
principl
of
common
citizenship

but
that
we
may
be
content
to
leav
to
destini

whose
outstretch
arm
mani
of
us
can
alreadi
clear
see


there
is
howev
an
import
question
we
must
ask
ourselv

would
a
special
relationship
between
the
unite
state
and
the
british
commonwealth
be
inconsist
with
our
over
ride
loyalti
to

organiz

i
repli
that

on
the
contrari

it
is
probabl
the
onli
mean
by
which
that
organ
will
achiev
it
full
statur
and
strength

there
are
alreadi
the
special

relat

i
have

and
there
are
the

our

of

with

i
agre
with
mr

the
foreign

of

that
it
might
well
be

so

none

it

of
a

gain
by
so
much
splendid
comradeship
in

in

but
we
should
be
most
unwis
not
to
face
them
squar
while
time
remain


the
outlook
is
also
anxious
in
the
far
east
and
especi
in
manchuria

the
agreement
which
was
made
at
yalta

to
which
i
was
a
parti

was
extrem
favor
to
soviet
russia

but
it
was
made
at
a
time
when
no
one
could
say
that
the
german
war
might
not
extend
all
through
the
summer
and
autumn
of
1945
and
when
the
japanes
war
was
expect
to
last
for
a
further
18
month
from
the
end
of
the
german
war

in
this
countri
you
are
all
so
well
inform
about
the
far
east

and
such
devot
friend
of
china

that
i
do
not
need
to
expati
on
the
situat
there


i
have
felt
bound
to
portray
the
shadow
which

alik
in
the
west
and
in
the
east

fall
upon
the
world

i
was
a
high
minist
at
the
time
of
the
versaill
treati
and
a
close
friend
of
mr

lloyd
georg

who
was
the
head
of
the
british
deleg
at
versaill

i
did
not
myself
agre
with
mani
thing
that
were
done

but
i
have
a
veri
strong
impress
in
my
mind
of
that
situat

and
i
find
it
pain
to
contrast
it
with
that
which
prevail
now

in
those
day
there
were
high
hope
and
unbound
confid
that
the
war
were
over

and
that
the
leagu
of
nation
would
becom
all
power

i
do
not
see
or
feel
that
same
confid
or
even
the
same
hope
in
the
haggard
world
at
the
present
time


on
the
other
hand
i
repuls
the
idea
that
a
new
war
is
inevit

still
more
that
it
is
immin

it
is
becaus
i
am
sure
that
our
fortun
are
still
in
our
own
hand
and
that
we
hold
the
power
to
save
the
futur

that
i
feel
the
duti
to
speak
out
now
that
i
have
the
occas
and
the
opportun
to
do
so

i
do
not
believ
that
soviet
russia
desir
war

what
they
desir
is
the
fruit
of
war
and
the
indefinit
expans
of
their
power
and
doctrin

but
what
we
have
to
consid
here
to
day
while
time
remain

is
the
perman
prevent
of
war
and
the
establish
of
condit
of
freedom
and
democraci
as
rapid
as
possibl
in
all
countri

our
difficulti
and
danger
will
not
be
remov
by
close
our
eye
to
them

they
will
not
be
remov
by
mere
wait
to
see
what
happen

nor
will
they
be
remov
by
a
polici
of
appeas

what
is
need
is
a
settlement

and
the
longer
this
is
delay

the
more
difficult
it
will
be
and
the
greater
our
danger
will
becom


from
what
i
have
seen
of
our
russian
friend
and
alli
dure
the
war

i
am
convinc
that
there
is
noth
they
admir
so
much
as
strength

and
there
is
noth
for
which
they
have
less
respect
than
for
weak

especi
militari
weak

for
that
reason
the
old
doctrin
of
a
balanc
of
power
is
unsound

we
cannot
afford

if
we
can
help
it

to
work
on
narrow
margin

offer
temptat
to
a
trial
of
strength

if
the
western
democraci
stand
togeth
in
strict
adher
to
the
principl
of
the
unite
nation
charter

their
influenc
for
further
those
principl
will
be
immens
and
no
one
is
like
to
molest
them

if
howev
they
becom
divid
or
falter
in
their
duti
and
if
these
all
import
year
are
allow
to
slip
away
then
inde
catastroph
may
overwhelm
us
all


last
time
i
saw
it
all
come
and
cri
aloud
to
my
own
fellow
countrymen
and
to
the
world

but
no
one
paid
ani
attent

up
till
the
year
1933
or
even
1935

germani
might
have
been
save
from
the
aw
fate
which
has
overtaken
her
and
we
might
all
have
been
spare
the
miseri
hitler
let
loos
upon
mankind

there
never
was
a
war
in
all
histori
easier
to
prevent
by
time
action
than
the
one
which
has
just
desol
such
great
area
of
the
globe

it
could
have
been
prevent
in
my
belief
without
the
fire
of
a
singl
shot

and
germani
might
be
power

prosper
and
honor
to
day

but
no
one
would
listen
and
one
by
one
we
were
all
suck
into
the
aw
whirlpool

we
sure
must
not
let
that
happen
again

this
can
onli
be
achiev
by
reach
now

in
1946

a
good

on
all

i

the

which
in

was

for

this

if

even
in

my

men

the

even
reap
someth
new

that
which
they
have
done
but
earnest
of
the
thing
that
they
shall
do



i
was
howev
a
littl
disquiet
that
you
find
it
necessari
to
debat
the
question

to
quot
dr

burchard
s
open
address


whether
the

of

product
yield
at

a

live

can
be

and
whether

has
so
destroy
the

that
he
may
be
doom
to
die
of
starvat


if

with
all
the
resourc
of
modern

we
find
ourselv
unabl
to
avert
world
famin

we
shall
all
be
to
blame

but
a
peculiar
respons
would
rest
upon
the
scientist

i
do
not
believ
they
will
fail

but
if
they
do

or
were
not
allow
to
succeed

the
consequ
would
be
veri
unpleas
becaus
it
is
certain
that
mankind
would
not
agre
to
starv
equal

and
there
might
be
some
veri
sharp
disagr
about
how
the
last
crust
was
to
be
share

this
would
simplifi
our
problem
in
an
unduli
primordi
manner


i
feel
somewhat
overaw
in
address
this
vast
scientif
and
learn
audienc
on
the
subject
which
your
panel
are
discuss

i
have
no
technic
and
no
univers
educ

and
have
just
had
to
pick
up
a
few
thing
as
i
went
along

therefor
i
speak
with
a
diffid

which
i
hope
to
overcom
as
i
proceed

on
these
profound
scientif

social
and
philosoph
issu

each
of
which
claim
a
life
long
studi
for
itself

and
are
now
to

examin

as

would

not

in

in

mean
therebi
not
onli
one
by

but
all
togeth


i
was
so
glad
that
in
the
first
instanc
you
ask
me
to
talk
about
the
past
rather
than
to
peer
into
the
futur
becaus
i
know
more
about
the
past
than
i
do
about
the
futur

and
i
was
well
content
that
the
presid
of
the

whose
gift
of
propheci
was
so
remark
vindic
by
recent
elector
result

should
have
accept
that
task

we
all
regret
that
his
heavi
state
duti
prevent
him
from
be
here
tonight

i
shall
therefor
present
have
to
do
a
littl
of
the
peer
myself


for
us
in

the
nineteenth
centuri
end
amid

they

and
that

would
fade

we
took
it
almost
for

i
cannot
speak
to
you
here
tonight
without

as
i
have
perhap
some
right
to

the

mani

have
risen

here
is
a
great
exampl
where
new
won
supremaci
has
not
been
use
for
self
aggrandis
but
onli
for
further
sacrific


three
year
ago
i
spoke
at
fulton
under
the
auspic
of
presid
truman

mani
peopl
here
and
in
my
own
countri
were
startl
and
even
shock
by
what
i
said

but
event
have
vindic
and
fulfil
in
much
detail
the
warn
which
i
deem
it
my
duti
to
give
at
that
time


today
there
is
a
veri
differ
climat
of
opinion

i
am
in
cordial
accord
with
much
that
is
be
done

we
have

as
domin
fact

the
famous
marshal
aid

the
new
uniti
in
western
europ
and
now
the
atlantic
pact

how
has
this
tremend
chang
in
our
outlook
and
polici
been
accomplish

the
respons
minist
in
all
the
countri
concern
deserv
high
credit

there
is
credit
enough
for
all

in
my
own
countri
the
foreign
secretari

mr

bevin

who
has
come
here
to
sign
the
atlantic
pact

has
shown
himself
indiffer
to
mere
parti
popular
in
deal
with
these
great
nation

he
has
shown
himself

like
mani
american
public
men

abov
mere
partisan
interest
in
deal
with
these
nation
and
world
issu

no
one
could
howev
have
brought
about
these
immens
chang
in
the
feel
of
the
unite
state

great
britain
and
europ
but
for
the
astound
polici
of
the
russian
soviet
govern

we
may
well
ask


whi
have
they
deliber
act
so
as
to
unit
the
free
world
against
them


it
is
certain
not
becaus
there
are
not
veri
abl
men
among
them

whi
have
they
done
it

i
offer
you
my
own
answer
to
this
strang
conundrum

it
is
becaus
they
fear
the
friendship
of
the
west
more
than
it
hostil

they
cannot
afford
to
allow
free
and
friend
intercours
to
grow
up
between
the
vast
area
they
control
and
the
civil
of
the
west

the
russian
peopl
must
not
see
what
goe
on
outsid

and
the
world
must
not
see
what
goe
on
insid
the
soviet
domain

fourteen
men
in
the
kremlin

hold
down
hundr
of
million
of
peopl
and
aim
at
the
rule
of
the
world
feel
that
at
all
cost
they
must
keep
up
the
barrier

self
preserv

not
for
russia
but
for
themselv

lie
at
the
root
and
is
the
explan
of
their
sinist
and
malign
polici


in
consequ
of
the
soviet
conduct
the
relat
of
communist
russia
with
the
other
great
power
of
the
world
are
without
preced
in
histori

measur
and
counter
measur
have
been
taken
on
mani
occas
which
in
ani
previous
period
could
onli
have
meant
arm
conflict

the
situat
has
been
well
describ
by
distinguish
american
as
the

cold
war


and
the
question
is
ask

are
we
win
the
cold
war


this
cannot
be
decid
by
look
at
europ
alon

we
must
also
look
to
asia

the
worst
disast
sinc
our
victori
has
been
the
collaps
of
china
under
communist
attack
and
intrigu

china

in
which
the
unite
state
have
alway
taken
a
high
interest

compris
an
immens
part
of
the
popul
of
the
world

the
absorpt
of
china
and
india
into
the
kremlin
control
communist
empire

would
certain
bring
measureless
bloodsh
and
miseri
to
eight
or
nine
hundr
million
peopl


on
the
other
hand

the
posit
in
europ
has
so
far
been
success
maintain

the
prodigi
effort
of
the
berlin
air
lift
has
carri
us
through
the
winter

time

though
dear
bought

has
been
gain
for
peac

the
effici
of
the
american
and
british
air
forc
has
been
prove
and
improv

most
of
all
the
spectacl
of
the
british
and
american
tri
to
feed
the
two
million
german
in
berlin

while
the
soviet
govern
was
tri
to
starv
them

has
been
an
object
lesson
to
the
german
peopl
far
beyond
anyth
that
word
could
convey

i
trust
that
small
and
needless
provoc
of
german
sentiment
may
be
avoid
by
the
western
power

the
reviv
and
union
of
europ
cannot
be
achiev
without
the
earnest
and
freeli
given
aid
of
the
german
peopl


the
air
lift
has
fulli
justifi
itself

nevertheless

fear
and
it
shadow
brood
over
western
europ
today

a
month
ago
in
brussel
i
spoke
to
a
meet
of
30
000
belgian

i
could
feel
at
onc
their
friendship
and
their
anxieti

they
have
no
atlantic
ocean

no
english
channel

between
them
and
the
russian
communist
armour
divis

yet
they
brave
and
ardent
support
the
caus
of
unite
europ

i
was
also
conscious
of
the
hope
and
faith
which
they

like
the
greek
peopl

place
in
the
unite
state


we
are
now
confront
with
someth
quit
as
wick
but
in
some
way
more
formid
than
hitler

becaus
hitler
had
onli
the
herrenvolk
pride
and
anti
semit
hatr
to
exploit

he
had
no
fundament
theme

but
these
fourteen
men
in
the
kremlin
have
their
hierarchi
and
a
church
of
communist
adept

whose
missionari
are
in
everi
countri
as
a
fifth
column

await
the
day
when
they
hope
to
be
the
absolut
master
of
their
fellow
countrymen
and
pay
off
old
score

they
have
their
anti
god
religion
and
their
communist
doctrin
of
the
entir
subjug
of
the
individu
to
the
state

behind
this
stand
the
largest
armi
in
the
world

in
the
hand
of
a
govern
pursu
imperialist
expans

as
no
czar
or
kaiser
had
ever
done


i
must
not
conceal
from
you
the
truth
as
i
see
it

it
is
certain
that
europ
would
have
been
communiz
and
london
under
bombard
some
time
ago
but
for
the
deterr
of
the
atomic
bomb
in
the
hand
of
the
unite
state


another
question
is
also
ask

is
time
on
our
side

that
is
not
a
question
that
can
be
answer
except
within
strict
limit

we
have
certain
not
an
unlimit
period
of
time
befor
a
settlement
should
be
achiev

the
utmost
vigil
should
be
practis
but
i
do
not
think
myself
that
violent
or
precipit
action
should
be
taken
now

war
is
not
inevit

the
german
have
a
wise
say


the
tree
do
not
grow
up
to
the
sky


often
someth
happen
to
turn
or
mitig
the
cours
of
event

four
or
five
hundr
year
ago
europ
seem
about
to
be
conquer
by
the
mongol

two
great
battl
were
fought
almost
on
the
same
day
near
vienna
and
in
poland

in
both
of
these
the
chivalri
and
arm
power
of
europ
was
complet
shatter
by
the
asiatic
hord

it
seem
that
noth
could
avert
the
doom
of
the
famous
contin
from
which
modern
civil
and
cultur
have
spread
throughout
the
world

but
at
the
critic
moment
the
great
khan
die

the
success
was
vacant

and
the
mongol
armi
and
their
leader
troop
back
on
their
poni
across
the
seven
thousand
mile
which
separ
them
from
their
capit
in
order
to
choos
a
successor

they
never
return
till
now


we
need
not
abandon
hope
or
patienc

mani
favor
process
are
on
foot

under
the
impact
of
commun
all
the
free
nation
are
be
weld
togeth
as
they
never
have
been
befor
and
never
could
be

but
for
the
harsh
extern
pressur
to
which
they
are
be
subject

we
have
no
hostil
to
the
russian
peopl
and
no
desir
to
deni
them
their
legitim
right
and
secur

i
hope
that
russia

after
the
war

would
have
access

through
unfrozen
water

into
everi
ocean

guarante
by
the
world
organiz
of
which
she
would
be
a
lead
member

that
she
should
have
the
freest
access

which
inde
she
has
at
the
present
time

to
raw
materi
of
everi
kind

and
that
the
russian
everywher
would
be
receiv
as
brother
in
the
human
famili

that
still
remain
our
aim
and
ideal

we
seek
noth
from
russia
but
goodwil
and
fair
play

if

howev

there
is
to
be
a
war
of
nerv

let
us
make
sure
our
nerv
are
strong
and
are
fortifi
by
the
deepest
convict
of
our
heart

if
we
persever
steadfast
togeth

and
allow
no
appeas
of
tyranni
and
wrong
do
in
ani
form

it
may
not
be
our
nerv
or
the
structur
of
our
civil
which
will
break

and
peac
may
yet
be
preserv


this
is
a
hard
experi
in
the
life
of
the
world

after
our
great
victori

which
we
believ
would
decid
the
struggl
for
freedom
for
our
time
at
least

we
thought
we
had
deserv
better
of
fortun

but
uniti
and
associ
are
be
establish
by
mani
nation
throughout
the
free

with
a
speed
and
realiti
which
would
not
have
been
achiev
perhap
for
generat

of
all
these
uniti
the
one
most
precious
to
me
is
the
fratern
associ
between
the
british
commonwealth
of
nation
and
the
unite
state

do
not
underr
the
strength
of
britain

as
i
said
at
fulton


do
not
suppos
that
half
a
centuri
from
now
you
will
not
see
seventi
or
eighti
million

spread
about

of
our

our
way
of

and
the
world
caus
which
you
and
we
espous


unite
we
stand
secur


let
us
then
move

mr

and
my

i
must
congratul
the

upon
the
high
level
maintain
dure
this

not
onli
have
the
speech
been
full
of
thought
which
have
their

valu
becaus
they
have
been

also
there
have
been

attempt
at

which
have
triumph
over

i
must
tell
you

are
none
too
good
and
which
will

i
trust

be

to
develop

like

i

that
in

will
be

organ
collect

rather
than
by

state
as
in

present
system

and
that
we
shall
be
abl
to
settl
a
great
mass
of
our
problem
among
ourselv
in
europ
befor
they
are
brought

or
instead
of
them
be
brought

to
the
world
council
for
decis


we
are
not
in
ani
way
the
rival
of
the
world
organ

we
are
a
subordin
but
essenti
element
in
it
ultim
structur

the
progress
of
our
first
meet
has
so
far
been
encourag

our
relat
with
the
committe
of
minist
show
a
desir
on
both
side
to
reach
a
work
harmoni

that
should
not
be
difficult
if
we
recogn
clear
what
our
respect
function
are

we
are
a
delib
assembl

and
we
must
have
full
freedom
of
discuss
on
all
question
except
defens

we
must
assert
our
right
to
this
freedom
and
we
must
have
our
own
parliamentari
offic
to
assist
us
in
our
debat

i
trust
that
the
necessari
amendment
to
the
statut
will
be
made
by
the
committe
of
minist
on
this
point
as
the
result
of
our
first
session
here
at
strasbourg


but
while
i
feel
that
we
should
insist
upon
full
freedom
of
debat
and
choic
of
subject

we
do
not
possess
execut
power

and
at
this
stage
in
our
develop
we
could
not
possibl
claim
it

our
foundat
by
select
by
the
govern
of
the
day
from
the
various
parliament
is
not
such
as
to
give
us
author
at
this
stage
to
take
decis

we
claim

howev

to
make
propos

it
is
not
for
us
to
make
decis
which
would
requir
execut
author

we
may
discuss
european
problem
and
tri
to
bring
about
a
sens
of
uniti

we
must
feel
our
way
forward
and

by
our
good
sens

build
up
an
increas
strength
and
reput

but
we
must
not
attempt
on
our
present
elector
basi
to
chang
the
power
which
belong
to
the
duli
constitut
nation
parliament
found
direct
upon
univers
suffrag


such
a
cours
would
be
prematur


it
would
be
detriment
to
our
long
term
interest

we
should

howev

do
our
utmost
to
secur
that
these
nation
parliament
examin
and
let
us
know
their
view
upon
ani
recommend
on
european
problem
that
we
may
make

that

i
think

we
may
requir
of
them

each
of
us

in
our
respect
parliament

should
take
the
opportun
to
rais
point
accord
to
the
procedur
which
prevail


i
touch
upon
some
of
the
point
which
are
upon
our
agenda

i
am
not
myself
commit
to
a
feder
or
ani
other
particular
solut
at
this
stage

we
must
thorough
explor
all
the
various
possibl

and
a
committe

work
coolli
and
without
hast

should

in
a
few
month

be
abl
to
show
the
practic
step
which
would
be
most
help
to
us

i
will
not
prejudg
the
work
of
the
committe

but
i
hope
they
will
rememb
napoleon
s
say


a
constitut
must
be
short
and
obscur


until
that
committe
report

i
think
we
should
be
well
advis
to
reserv
our
judgment


i
am
in
accord
with
what
mr

morrison
has
said
on
this
subject

i
share
his
view
that
we
would
be
wise
to
see
what
are
the
recommend
of
our
committe
which

i
hope

will
sit
perman
and
not
be
broken
up
by
our
departur

to
take
a
home
and
familiar
test

we
may
just
as
well
see
what
the
girl
look
like
befor
we
marri
her

it
is
to
our
advantag
to
have
an
opportun
of
make
a
detail
examin
of
these
problem


then
there
is
the
question
of
human
right

which
is
the
second
subject
set
down
on
our
agenda

we
attach
great
import
to
his

mr

presid

and
are
glad
that
the
obstacl
to
discuss
by
the
assembl
have
now
been
remov
by
the
committe
of
minist

a
european
assembl
forbidden
to
discuss
human
right
would
inde
have
been
a
ludicr
proposit
to
put
to
the
world

again

i
should
like
to
see
the
report
of
the
committe
on
this
subject
befor
we
put
forward
our
propos
to
the
committe
of
minist

there
is
an
urgenc
about
this

becaus
onc
the
foundat
of
human
right
is
agre
on
the
line
of
the
decis
of
the
unite
nation
at
geneva

but
i
trust
in
much
shorter
form

we
hope
that
a
european
court
might
be
set
up

befor
which
case
of
the
violat
of
these
right
in
our
own
bodi
of
twelv
nation
might
be
brought
to
the
judgment
of
the
civil
world

such
a
court

of
cours

would
have
no
sanction
and
would
depend
for
the
enforc
of
their
judgment
on
the
individu
decis
of
the
state
now
band
togeth
in
this
council
of
europ

but
these
state
would
have
subscrib
beforehand
to
the
process

and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
great
bodi
of
public
opinion
in
all
these
countri
would
press
for
action
in
accord
with
the
freeli
given
decis


i
now
come
to
the
question
of
the
empti
seat

which
was
put
befor
us
by
m

andrew
philip

ten
ancient
capit
of
europ
are
behind
the
iron
curtain

a
larg
part
of
this
contin
is
held
in
bondag

they
have
escap
from
nazism
onli
to
fall
into
the
other
extrem
of
commun

it
is
like
make
a
long
and
agon
journey
to
leav
the
north
pole
onli
to
find
out
that

as
a
result

you
have
woken
up
in
the
south
pole

all
around
are
onli
ice
and
snow
and
bitter
pierc
wind

we
should
certain
make
some
provis
for
associ
with
repres
of
these
countri

who
are
depriv
of
ordinari
democrat
freedom
but
who
will
sure
regain
it
in
the
long
march
of
time

this
is
a
matter
which
should
be
care
consid
by
the
assembl

and
i
agre
with
all
those

and
there
are
mani

who
have
spoken
in
favor
of
set
asid
some
seat
in
the
assembl
as
a
symbol
of
proof
of
our
intent
that
the
assembl
shall
someday
repres
all
europ

or
all
europ
west
of
the
curzon
line

i
now
come

sir

to
the
greatest
and
most
import
of
all
the
question
that
are
befor
us

a
unit
europ
cannot
live
without
the
help
and
strength
of
germani

this
has
alway
been
foreseen
by
the
european
movement

to
whose
exert
our
presenc
here
is
due

at
the
hagu

14
month
ago

where
we
resolv
to
press
for
the
format
of
this
assembl

a
german
deleg
was
present
and
was
welcom
by
all

especi
the
repres
of
franc

one
of
the
most
practic
reason
for
press
forward
with
the
creation
of
a
european
assembl
was
that
is
procreat
of
a
european
assembl
was
that
it
provid
an
effect
mean

and
possibl
the
onli
immedi
effect
mean

of
associ
a
democrat
and
free
germani
with
the
western
democraci


it
is
too
earli
to
judg
the
result
of
the
german
elect

but
so
far
as
we
can
yet
appreci
the
result

mani
of
us

apart
from
parti
consider

may
have
felt
encourag
by
the
evid
size
and
valid
of
the
poll
and
by
the
general
result


we
cannot
part
at
the
end
of
this
month
on
the
basi
that
we
do
noth
more
to
bring
germani
into
our
circl
until
a
year
has
pass

that
year
is
too
precious
to
lose

if
lost

it
might
be
lost
forev

it
might
not
be
a
year

but
it
might
be
the
year


on
the
other
hand

i
am
assur

and
here
i
must
break
the
rule
which
mr

harold
macmillan
laid
down
this
morn

that
the
world

imposs

must
never
be
use
again


that
it
is
physic
imposs
for
ani
german
govern
that
may
emerg
in
the
next
few
week
to
be
repres
here
befor
we
separ

i
need
scarc
say
that
i
should
be
veri
glad
if
a
way
could
be
found

if

howev

this
cannot
be
found

then
we
must
draw
the
attent
of
the
committe
of
minist
to
articl
34
of
the
statut

which
say


the
committe
of
minist
may
convok
an
extraordinari
session
of
the
consult
assembl
at
such
time
and
place
as
the
committe

with
the
concurr
of
the
presid
of
the
assembl
shall
decid



i
think
we
must
ask
that
an
assur
shall
be
given
to
us
befor
we
separ
that
the
committe
of
minist
will
convok
an
extraordinari
session
under
this
articl
34
in
decemb
or
in
januari

i
person

should
be
content
to
leav
the
matter
in
the
hand
of
the
committe
of
minist

and
even
to
forego
our
claim
for
a
debat
upon
this
subject
at
this
junctur


i
would
ask
that
we
should
receiv
an
assur
that
an
extraordinari
session
will
be
conven
and
i
appeal
to
you

mr

vice
presid

person
to
place
yourself
in
communic
with
m

speak
and
urg
him
to
confer
with
the
committe
of
minist
upon
this
subject

so
that
we
may
have
an
answer
and
know
what
cours
we
should
take
in
the
limit
number
of
day
and
week
which
are
at
our
dispos


when
we
meet
in
the
extraordinari
session


if
one
is
grate


in
decemb
or
januari
next

it
is
my
hope
that
we
shall
find
ourselv
alreadi
join
a
german
deleg
similar
to
that
of
other
member
state

but
if
this
cannot
be
done
then
will
be
the
time
for
us
to
debat
the
issu
in
full
freedom

mr

vice
presid

i
earnest
hope
that
an
agreement
on
this
matter
may
be
reach
along
these
line

and
that
we
may
be
inform
of
it
as
soon
as
possibl

it
would
enabl
us
to
avoid
various
serious
difficulti
at
the
present
moment

and
would

i
think

give
the
best
chanc
for
the
futur
develop
of
the
european
assembl

and
the
best
chanc
of
make
sure
that
the
peac
of
europ
will
be
given
everi
opportun
to
consolid
itself

such
an
event
as
the
arriv
in
our
midst
of
a
german
deleg
as
a
result
of
our
work
here
this
month
would
certain
crown
our
first
session
with
a
solid
and
memor
achiev

and
would
have
a
high
benefici
result
in
the
caus
of
world
peac
and
european
secur


i
have
onli
ventur
to
deal
with
these
particular
import
practic
point

and
i
have
not
attempt
to
speak
of
the
sentiment
and
moral
aspect
of
our
work

i
hope
that
we
shall
not
put
our
trust
in
formula
or
in
machineri

there
are
plenti
of
formula


slogan

i
think
mr

morrison
call
them



and

in
spite
of
all
the
misfortun
which
have
occur

there
is
still
plenti
of
machineri
in
the
polit
field

it
is
by
the
spirit
that
we
shall
establish
our
forc

and
it
is
by
the
growth
and
gather
of
the
unit
sentiment
of
european

vocal
here
an
list
to
all
over
the
world

that
we
shall
succeed
in
take

not
execut
decis

but
in
take
a
lead
and
activ
part
in
the
reviv
of
the
greatest

which
has
fallen
into
the
worst
of

whereas

been

a

be
releg

our

which
is
just
northwest
of

we
found
out
that

of
enlist
men
to
receiv
the

we
were

the

the

the
next
morn
when

we
just
miss
the

they
were
in
the

the
old
torpedo
plane

we
had
the
new
one

the
ship
was
gone

they
were
tri
to
build
up
the
forc
on
the
island
of
midway
as
well
as
they
could

so
they
decid
to
get
the

we
can
get
readi
and
fli
them
out
to
midway

and
i
was
one
of

we
were
led
by

of

we

who
had
been
left

what
were
your
impress
of
the
plane
itself


earnest

i
have
to
say

the
tbd
devast

was
a
fair
good
airplan
for
it
time

but
the
time
has
long
pass

it
was
quit
slow

especi
after
you
put
in
armor
plate
and
gun

and
then
you
put
a
torpedo
under
it

it
was
most
expos

that
slow
it
down
a
great
deal

it
was
quit
slow

the
tbf
was
much
much
faster

it
carri
the
torpedo
intern

and
was
just
a
far
superior
airplan

we
got
out
there

we
were
told
that
the
carrier
were
back
protect
the
hawaiian
island

and
we
shouldn
t
expect
ani
help
from
them

and
anyth
that
had
to
be
done
had
to
be
done
by
the
airplan
on
the
island
that
they
had
for
us

the
island
was
cover
by
airplan

the
marin
had
dive
bomber
and
fighter

i
should
say
old
dive
bomber
and
old
fighter

they
had
veri
few
of
the

and
the

was
cover
with

the

the

i

it
look

i
thought
well
this
will
be
fair
easi

all
of
a
sudden
i
saw
two
carrier
and
all
the
ship
all
around

a
battleship

cruiser

and
so
on

it
was
a
veri
larg
screen

we
were
just
approach
it

we
head
down
to
make
our
run
on
the
carrier

which
were
quit
a
long

away
from

just
at
that

the

fighter
hit

they
were
all

there
must
had

they
were
get
into

s

make
run
on
us

at

more
or
less

it
was
pretti
terrifi

i
can
tell
you

especi
when
the
cannon
shell
would
hit
us
in
the
wing
and
i
was
hit
by
a
piec
of
shrapnel

my
turret
gunner
fire
for
a
while

and
then
he
stop
fire

and
i
guess
he
d
just
been
kill

the
tunnel
gunner
was
wound
by
a
piec
of
shrapnel
or
a
shell

so
he
was
out
of

action

do
you
have
time
to
even
think
about
what
s
go
on

i
mean

was
there
much
to
think
about
as
you
bore
in

as
you
mention
it
was
kind
of
a
terrifi
experi
becaus
just
for
the
amount
of
opposit
you
face


earnest

we
hadn
t
chang
our
posit

we
were
still
on
the
left
wing
of
the
leader
and
we
were
head
on
in

hope
we
would
get
there

but

as
i
said

these
fighter
were
get
into
each
other
s
way

there
were
so
mani
of
them

make
run
on
us

becaus
i
was
hit

of
cours

i
had
blood
all
over
the
place

i
didn
t
know
how
bad
i
was
hit

it
didn
t
hurt

but
sort
of
shock

at
that
time
my
elev
control
went
out

they
shatter
the
elev
control

so
the
airplan
start
just



we
were
onli
two
or
three
hundr
feet

it
start
down

and
i
realiz
i
was
go
into
the
water

so
i
kick
it
with



there
was
a
cruiser
off
on
the
port
side

so
i
kick
it
to
the
left



with
the
rudder
and
the
aileron

and
tri
to
get
a
good
lead
on
the
cruiser
and
let
it
drop

and
sort
of
stood
by
to
hit
the
water

just
as
i
was
about
to
hit
the
water

my
instict
which
was
that
as
i
land
i
alway
roll
by
elev
tab
back

and
my
hand
just
went
on
the
elev
tab
and
did
it

the
airplan
jump
back
up
in
the
air
and
i
realiz
that
i
can
control
it
with
the
tab
rather
than
the
elev
control

so
this
is
trim
tab

i
realiz
that
two
of
the
fighter
were
still
after
me

so
i
was
turn

jink

and
do
everyth
i
could
to
get
them
off
my
tail

but
not
with
much
effect

they
were
just
shoot
the
hell
out
of
me

the
airplan
and
me
and
so
on

but
after
what
seem
like
an
hour
but
i
guess
was
two
or
three
minut

they
left

i
never
knew
whi

the
airplan
engin
had
miss
onc

but
it
was
run
fine

they
had
chase
me
to
the
north

so
that
the
fleet
was
between
me
and
midway

i
kind
of
gather
myself

realiz
the
airplan
was
still
fli

and
i
was
still
in
one
piec

i
guess
i
stop
bleed

i
m
not
sure
when
that
happen

but
at
ani
rate
i
realiz
i
had
to
get
back

i
didn
t
see
ani
of
the
other
pilot

i
look
back
at
the
fleet

and
there
didn
t
seem
to
be
ani
damag
that
i
can
see

i
decid
that
sinc
it
s
earli
in
the
morn
and
we
had
come
out
head
northwest

the
thing
for
me
to
do

rather
than
fli
back
over
the
jap
fleet

was
to
head
straight
south
until
i
figur
i
was
to
the
west
of
midway
and
then
turn
due
east

the
sun
was
still
rather
low
in
the
sky
so
i
knew
where
east
was

but
i
didn
t
have
a
compass

the
compass
was
back
in
the
tail
of
the
airplan

and
at
that
time
it
was
the
onli
one
they
had

but
it
was
shot
up
complet
so
i
didn
t
have
a
compass

my
hydraul
system
was
gone

the
bomb
bay
door
was
still
open

i
couldn
t
close
them

but
the
airplan
was
fli
fine

so
i
climb
to
about
4
or
5
thousand
feet
i
guess
and
head
on
south

i
saw
some
other
airplan
over
in
the
distanc
head
back

but
i
don
t
know
whether
if
they
were
japanes
or
whether
they
were
marin
come
ahead

at
ani
rate

my
job
at
that
time
was
to
get
back
to
midway

so
i
flew
south
until
i
thought
i
was
probabl
west
of
midway

and
then
i
turn
east

littl
befor
that
all
of
a
sudden
my
tunnel
gunner
got
on
the
radio

the
intercom

and
said
he
had
been
hit

was
knock
out

but
he
was
ok
now

so
he
got
up
and
got
into
the
second
seat
of
the
airplan
which
in
the
earli
version
we
had
a
seat
right
behind
the
pilot

i
ask
him
if
he
could
see
whether
the
torpedo
was
gone

and
he
said
he
couldn
t

apparent
the
blood
from
the
turret
gunner
was
cover
the
littl
window
that
he
would
use
to
look
into
the
bomb
bay

at
ani
rate

i
head
east
and
i
decid
i
would
climb
up
a
bit
when
i
did
i
saw
some
black
smoke

which
i
figur
must
be
midway

i
drop
down
to
see
if
i
can
see
the
base
through
the
smoke
and
there
was
the
island
of
kuri

which
kuri
was
about
50
mile
to
the
west
of
midway

so
i
knew
where
i
was

i
went
on
in
and
made
my
land

and
i
couldn
t
get
but
one
wheel
down

appar
one
of
the
wire
that
releas
the
wheel
was
shot
up
so
onli
one
wheel
would
come
down

i
didn
t
have
ani
flap
of
cours
becaus
no
hydraul

so
they
wave
me
off
a
coupl
of
time

but
i
final
came
on
in
and
land
on
one
wheel

it
was
a
veri
nice
land

just
park
it
after
the
right
wing
drop

and
park
itself
off
the
runway

it
is
surpris
at
all
to
have
peopl
50
year

take
a
look
at
all
these
differ
attack
that
were
made

driven

your

those
you

the

the
obvious
later
on

three
torpedo
attack
from

carrier

my
understand
had
been

we
were
suppos

join
up

and
i
don

we
just
straight

out
there

i
don

know
what
our
leader
fieberl
was
told
but
we
went
straight
on
out
and
made
our
attack
with
no
help
from
anybodi
els
as
far
as
we
knew

when
you
look
back
on
it

wasn
t
a
veri
smart
thing
to
do


bresnahan

it
was
rather
shock

with
the
amount
of
loss
and
the
sacrific
that
was
made


earnest

of
cours
i
didn

know
ani

until
much
later

after
i
got
back

one
of
the
hornet
bomber
squadron
came
in

land
at
midway

i

were
hit
in

final
we
start
get

had
been
success

i
didn

all

georg

anoth

afterward
i

we
didn

realli
know

befor

re
realli
fantast

well

well
design
airplan

it
had

major
problem

it
didn

have
bullet
proof
tank

so
if
you
did
ani
fire
at

when
fight
anoth

if
you
could
get
into
posit
and
get
ani
hit
on

you
had
a

to
shoot
him
down

when
did
you
final
hear
about

damag
suffer

a

of
oepol
mention

ultim
led

i
talk
to
a
japanes

pilot
down
at
pensacola
a

his
comment
was

you
guy
just
kept
come
and
come
and
come


they
were
in
the
area

expect
after
a
certain
amount
of
time
to
be
reliev
and
refuel
and
rearm

but
there
was
alway
anoth
attack
come
in

they
had
to
keep
them
after
it

that
s
about
the
onli
credit
we
torpedo
pilot
could
take
for
that
day

we
kept
come
at
them
and
one
after
anoth
after
anoth

we
didn

which
becam
veri
success

especi
with

i
never

even
when

it
was
wonder

fighter
came
straight
down
shoot
their
50
calib
and
dive
bomber
right
after

we
came
in

made
our

your
onli
carrier
battl

were
you
involv
in
smaller
battl
too


earnest

i
was
involv
in
the
battl
of
the
eastern
solomon
which
was

let
s
say

that
was
august
the
23rd
i
think

i
was
on
the
saratoga

we
got
back
to
pearl
harbor
and
they
decid
to
put
us
on
saratoga
becaus
saratoga
was
readi
to
go

and
guadalcan
was
come
up

we
didn
t
know
what
was
come
up

but
we
knew
we
were
go
somewher

so
we
were
put
on
saragoa
with
the
tbfs
and
went
down
there
with
anoth
air
gorup

support
the
land
on
guadalcan
and
then
cruis
up
and
down
the
coral
sea

the
japanes
carrier
came
down
and
i
went
out
on
an
attack
that
we
sank
the
ryujo

we
didn
t
get
the
big
carrier

the
japanes
had
a
veri
good
habit
of
put
out
the
smaller
carrier
ahead
of
the
other
and
it
was
sort
of
the
decoy

we
sank
it

it
was
a
good
littl
carrier
but
it
wasn
t
as
big
as
shokaku
or
zuikaku

at
that
time
you
know
you
never
think
too
much
about
get
kill

but
i
think
most
of
us
at
that
time
felt
that
this
was
probabl
go
to
be
it

when
you
figur
that
we
brought
back
out
of
our
air
group
onli
16
pilot
plus
3
that
were
later
pick
up

we
were
pretti
near
right


i
think
everybodi
with
a
few
rare
except
made
determin
attack

it
was
just
that
unfortun
the
torpedo
plane
were
slow

which
was
their
biggest
fail

they
never
could
realli
get
in
posit

when
they
tri
to
get
into
posit
to
make
coordin
attack
from
each
of
the
bow

that
is
left
and
right

they
simpli
were
shot
down
one
by
one

but
the
fact
that
they
kept
go
on
in

i
would
expect
it
of
them

i
think
everybodi
would
have
done
that

i
think
the
thought
were
that
whatev
happen
they
would
go
in
until
the
last
man
was
gone

they
were
that
kind
of
peopl


i
was
one
of
the
few
individu
that
had
access
to
those
magic
dispatch
on
the
carrier
becaus
i
was
in
essenc
the
group
oper
offic
and
therefor
the
predictor
for
the
dive
bomber
and
scout

so
i
was
well
awar
person
of
the
number
and
i
think
that
in
general
the
inform
was
avail
to
all
of
the
air
group
as
to
what
was
there

halsey
told
us
a
certain
amount
what
ship
we
were
up
against

so
i
don
t
think
there
were
ani
illus


as
we
went
out
and
couldn
t
find
the
japanes
carrier
fleet

our
group
command
turn
north

and
the
air
group
who
was
from
the
hornet
turn
south
toward
midway

stan
ring
did

command
ring

and
they
never
found
anyth

but
as
we
turn
north

within
a
few
minut

the
group
command
pick
up
a
singl
destroy
who
had
been
left
behind
by
the
japanes
to
keep
an
american
submarin
down
that
had
been
spot

figur
that
the
destroy
was
head
back
to
the
rest
of
the
japanes
fleet

mccluski
turn
to
that
cours
and
follow
the
destroy

went
on
past
it

we
were
up
at
about
24
000
feet
and
sudden
we
broke
out
into
the
clear
and
there
were
four
japanes
carrier
and
everyth

and
we
knew
we
had
them



i
won
t
use
the
colloqui



but
you
know
what
we
had
them
by


so
we
start
our
approach

that
mean
we
push
over
and
went
down
about
19
000
to
20
000
feet

pick
up
speed

and
we
got
in
posit
over
them
on
attack

at
that
time
the
group
command
gave
order
to
dick
best
and
bomb
6
to
take
one
of
the
carrier
and
told
earl
gallah

who
is
the
other
squadron
command
that
is
the
squadron
of
which
i
was
exec

to
take
the
other
one

we
made
our
attack
on
them

at
the
same
time

to
the
northeast

one
of
the
other
squadron
from
the
yorktown
came
in
and
spot
one
of
the
carrier

and
as
a
great
coincid
dive
within
15
to
20
second
of
the
same
time
our
two
squadron
dive

and
so
as
i
pull
out
there
were
three
carrier
burn
and
the
fourth
carrier
was
off
to
the
northwest

hightail
it
back
under
the
cloud


well
i
d
say
i
did

score
a
hit


i
reckon
there
were
probabl
more
hit
claim
than
actual
were
hit

but
yes

i
think
i
got
a
hit
alright


as
i
describ
it
in
my
book
the
scene
was
one
of

i
think
everybodi
was
jubil

we
all
could
see
the
carrier
burn

we
knew
that
this
was
the
whole
heart
of
the






well
it
was
to
get
those
four
japanes
carrier

and
here
were
three
that
were
burn

so
i
m
sure
that
everybodi
felt
quit
jubil

then
the
problem
was
to
get
home
becaus
down
low
the
air
was
full
of
japanes
fighter
and
destroy

of
cours

we
were
down
to
around
300
or
400
feet
and
all
of
the
destroy
were
shoot
at
us

you
just
had
to
bore
out
and
get
out
of
the
ring
of
ship
and
get
back
on
home


when
i
made
it
back
to
the
enterpris
the
interest
thing
was



i
got
one
of
the
japanes
plane
as
he
flew
underneath
me
and
pull
ahead
of
me
and
he
didn
t
see
me

so
i

after
deliber

becaus
i
knew
if
i
miss
him
he
was
gonna
be
mad
and
would
come
up
after
me

i
just
put
the
nose
of
the
plane
down
and
shot
him
up
the
rear

then
he
went
into
the
water

then
we
came
on
home

and
that
is
head
for
the
american
fleet

and
some
made
it
and
some
didn
t

a
lot
went
into
the
water
and
were
never
pick
up

but
that
s
anoth
stori

as
we
came
on
back

of
cours
we
were
run
out
of
gas
as
i
said

and
i
was
about
5
mile
from
the
enterpris
when
i
ran
out
of
gas

so
i
put
the
plane
down

the
sea
was
quit
calm

3
or
4
good
wave

and
land
the
plane
ahead
of
this
destroy

and
it
turn
out
that
this
was
the
destroy
the
phelp
dd
360
that
i
had
been
on
for
a
coupl
of
year
back
in
the
late
30s
