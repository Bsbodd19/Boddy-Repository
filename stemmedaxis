deputi

men
of
the
german
reichstag


at
a
time
when
onli
deed
count
and
word
are
of
littl
import

it
is
not
my
intent
to
appear
befor
you

the
elect
repres
of
the
german
peopl

more
often
than
absolut
necessari

the
first
time
i
spoke
to
you
was
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
when

thank
to
the
anglo
french
conspiraci
against
peac

everi
attempt
at
an
understand
with
poland

which
otherwis
would
have
been
possibl

had
been
frustrat


the
most
unscrupul
men
of
the
present
time
had

as
they
admit
today

decid
as
earli
as
1936
to
involv
the
reich

which
in
it
peac
work
of
reconstruct
was
becom
too
power
for
them

in
a
new
and
bloodi
war
and

if
possibl

to
destroy
it

they
had
final
succeed
in
find
a
state
that
was
prepar
for
their
interest
and
aim

and
that
state
was
poland


all
my
endeavor
to
come
to
an
understand
with
britain
were
wreck
by
the
determin
of
a
small
cliqu
which

whether
from
motiv
of
hate
or
for
the
sake
of
materi
gain

reject
everi
german
propos
for
an
understand
due
to
their
resolv

which
they
never
conceal

to
resort
to
war

whatev
happen


the
man
behind
this
fanat
and
diabol
plan
to
bring
about
war
at
whatev
cost
was
mr

churchil

his
associ
were
the
men
who
now
form
the
british
govern

ment


these
endeavor
receiv
most
power
support

both
open
and
secret

from
the
so
call
great
democraci
on
both
side
of
the
atlantic

at
a
time
when
the
peopl
were
more
and
more
dissatisfi
with
their
defici
statesmanship

the
respons
men
over
there
believ
that
a
success
war
would
be
the
most
like
mean
of
solv
problem
that
otherwis
would
be
beyond
their
power
to
solv


behind
these
men
there
stood
the
great
intern
jewish
financi
interest
that
control
the
bank
and
the
stock
exchang
as
well
as
the
armament
industri

and
now

just
as
befor

they
scent
the
opportun
of
do
their
unsavori
busi

and
so

just
as
befor

there
was
no
scrupl
about
sacrif
the
blood
of
the
peopl

that
was
the
begin
of
this
war

a
few
week
later
the
state
that
was
the
third
countri
in
europ

poland

but
had
been
reckless
enough
to
allow
herself
to
be
use
for
the
financi
interest
of
these
warmong

was
annihil
and
destroy


in
these
circumst
i
consid
that
i
owe
it
to
our
german
peopl
and
countless
men
and
women
in
the
opposit
camp

who
as
individu
were
as
decent
as
they
were
innoc
of
blame

to
make
yet
anoth
appeal
to
the
common
sens
and
the
conscienc
of
these
statesmen

on
october
6

1939

i
therefor
onc
more
public
state
that
germani
had
neither
demand
nor
intend
to
demand
anyth
either
from
britain
or
from
franc

that
it
was
mad
to
continu
the
war
and

abov
all

that
the
scourg
of
modern
weapon
of
warfar

onc
they
were
brought
into
action

would
inevit
ravag
vast
territori


but
just
as
the
appeal
i
made
on
septemb
1

1939

prove
to
be
in
vain

this
renew
appeal
met
with
indign
reject

the
british
and
their
jewish
capitalist
backer
could
find
no
other
explan
for
this
appeal

which
i
had
made
on
humanitarian
ground

than
the
assumpt
of
weak
on
the
part
of
germani


they
assur
the
peopl
of
britain
and
franc
that
germani
dread
the
clash
to
be
expect
in
the
spring
of
1940
and
was
eager
to
make
peac
for
fear
of
the
annihil
that
would
then
inevit
result


alreadi
at
that
time
the
norwegian
govern

misl
by
the
stubborn
insist
of
mr

churchil
s
fals
propheci

began
to
toy
with
the
idea
of
a
british
land
on
their
soil

therebi
contribut
to
the
destruct
of
germani
by
permit
their
harbor
and
swedish
iron
ore
field
to
be
seiz


so
sure
were
mr

churchil
and
paul
reynaud
of
the
success
of
their
new
scheme
that
final

whether
from
sheer
reckless
or
perhap
under
the
influenc
of
drink

they
deem
it
no
longer
necessari
to
make
a
secret
of
their
intent


it
was
thank
to
these
two
gentlemen
s
tendenc
to
gossip
that
the
german
govern
at
that
time
gain
cogniz
of
the
plan
be
made
against
the
reich

a
few
week
later
this
danger
to
germani
was
elimin

one
of
the
boldest
deed
of
arm
in
the
whole
histori
of
warfar
frustrat
the
attack
of
the
british
and
french
armi
against
the
right
flank
of
our
line
of
defens


immediat
after
the
failur
of
these
plan

increas
pressur
was
exert
by
the
british
warmong
upon
belgium
and
holland

now
that
the
attack
upon
our
sourc
for
the
suppli
of
iron
ore
had
prove
unsuccess

they
aim
to
advanc
the
front
to
the
rhine
by
involv
the
belgian
and
dutch
state
and
thus
to
threaten
and
paralyz
our
product
center
for
iron
and
steel


on
may
10
of
last
year
perhap
the
most
memor
struggl
in
all
german
histori
commenc

the
enemi
front
was
broken
up
in
a
few
day
and
the
stage
was
then
set
for
the
oper
that
culmin
in
the
greatest
battl
of
annihil
in
the
histori
of
the
world

thus
franc
collaps

belgium
and
holland
were
alreadi
occupi

and
the
batter
remnant
of
the
british
expeditionari
forc
were
driven
from
the
european
contin

leav
their
arm
behind


on
juli
19

1940

i
then
conven
the
german
reichstag
for
the
third
time
in
order
to
render
that
great
account
which
you
all
still
rememb

the
meet
provid
me
with
the
opportun
of
express
the
thank
of
the
nation
to
it
soldier
in
a
form
suit
to
the
uniqu
of
the
event

once
again
i
seiz
the
opportun
of
urg
the
world
to
make
peac

and
what
i
foresaw
and
prophesi
at
that
time
happen

my
offer
of
peac
was
misconstru
as
a
symptom
of
fear
and
cowardic


the
european
and
american
warmong
succeed
onc
again
in
befog
the
sound
common
sens
of
the
mass

who
can
never
hope
to
profit
from
this
war

by
conjur
up
fals
pictur
of
new
hope

thus

final

under
pressur
of
public
opinion

as
form
by
their
press

they
onc
more
manag
to
induc
the
nation
to
continu
this
struggl


even
my
warn
against
night
bomb
of
the
civilian
popul

as
advoc
by
mr

churchil

were
interpret
as
a
sign
of
german
impot

he

the
most
bloodthirsti
or
amateurish
strategist
that
histori
has
ever
known

actual
saw
fit
to
believ
that
the
reserv
display
for
month
by
the
german
air
forc
could
be
look
upon
onli
as
proof
of
their
incapac
to
fli
by
night


so
this
man
for
month
order
his
paid
scribbler
to
deceiv
the
british
peopl
into
believ
that
the
royal
air
forc
alon


and
no
other


was
in
a
posit
to
wage
war
in
this
way

and
that
thus
way
and
mean
had
been
found
to
forc
the
reich
to
it
knee
by
the
ruthless
onslaught
of
the
british
air
forc
on
the
german
civilian
popul
in
conjunct
with
the
starvat
blockad


again
and
again
i
utter
these
warn
against
this
specif
type
of
aerial
warfar

and
i
did
so
for
over
three
and
a
half
month

that
these
warn
fail
to
impress
mr

churchil
doe
not
surpris
me
in
the
least

for
what
doe
this
man
care
for
the
live
of
other

what
doe
he
care
for
cultur
or
for
architectur

when
war
broke
out
he
state
clear
that
he
want
to
have
his
war

even
though
the
citi
of
england
might
be
reduc
to
ruin

so
now
he
has
got
his
war


my
assur
that
from
a
given
moment
everi
one
of
his
bomb
would
be
return
if
necessari
a
hundredfold
fail
to
induc
this
man
to
consid
even
for
an
instant
the
crimin
natur
of
his
action

he
profess
not
to
be
in
the
least
depress
and
he
even
assur
us
that
the
british
peopl

too

after
such
bomb
raid

greet
him
with
a
joyous
seren

caus
him
to
return
to
london
refresh
by
his
visit
to
the
stricken
area


it
is
possibl
that
this
sight
strengthen
mr

churchil
in
his
firm
determin
to
continu
the
war
in
this
way

and
we
are
no
less
determin
to
continu
to
retali

if
necessari

a
hundr
bomb
for
everi
one
of
his
and
to
go
on
do
so
until
the
british
nation
at
last
get
rid
of
this
crimin
and
his
method


the
appeal
to
forsak
me

made
to
the
german
nation
by
this
fool
and
his
satellit
on
may
day

of
all
day

are
onli
to
be
explain
either
as
symptomat
of
a
paralyt
diseas
or
of
a
drunkard
s
rave

his
abnorm
state
of
mind
also
gave
birth
to
a
decis
to
transform
the
balkan
into
a
theater
of
war


for
over
five
year
this
man
has
been
chase
around
europ
like
a
madman
in
search
of
someth
that
he
could
set
on
fire

unfortun

he
again
and
again
find
hirel
who
open
the
gate
of
their
countri
to
this
intern
incendiari


after
he
had
succeed
in
the
cours
of
the
past
winter
in
persuad
the
british
peopl
by
a
wave
of
fals
assert
and
pretens
that
the
german
reich

exhaust
by
the
campaign
in
the
preced
month

was
complet
spent

he
saw
himself
oblig

in
order
to
prevent
an
awaken
of
the
truth

to
creat
a
fresh
conflagr
in
europ


in
so
do
he
return
to
the
project
that
had
been
in
his
mind
as
earli
as
the
autumn
of
1939
and
the
spring
of
1940

it
was
thought
possibl
at
the
time
to
mobil
about
100
divis
in
britain
s
interest


the
sudden
collaps
which
we
wit
in
may
and
june
of
the
past
year
forc
these
plan
to
be
abandon
for
the
moment

but
by
the
autumn
of
last
year
mr

churchil
began
to
tackl
this
problem
onc
again


in
the
meantim

howev

certain
difficulti
had
arisen

as
a
result

rumania

owe
to
intern
chang

drop
out
of
england
s
polit
scheme


in
deal
with
these
condit

i
shall
begin
by
give
you
a
brief
outlin
of
the
aim
of
germani
s
polici
in
the
balkan

as
in
the
past

the
reich
never
pursu
ani
territori
or
ani
other
selfish
polit
interest
in
the
balkan

in
other
word

the
reich
has
never
taken
the
slightest
interest
in
territori
problem
and
intern
condit
in
these
state
for
ani
selfish
reason
whatsoev


on
the
other
hand

the
reich
has
alway
endeavor
to
build
up
and
to
strengthen
close
econom
tie
with
these
state
in
particular

this

howev

not
onli
serv
the
interest
of
the
reich
but
equal
the
interest
of
these
countri
themselv


if
ani
two
nation
econom
system
ever
effect
complement
one
anoth

that
is
especi
the
case
regard
the
balkan
state
and
germani

germani
is
an
industri
countri
and
requir
foodstuff
and
raw
materi

the
balkan
state
are
agrarian
countri
and
are
short
of
these
raw
materi

at
the
same
time

they
requir
industri
product


it
was
therefor
hard
surpris
when
germani
thus
becam
the
main
busi
partner
of
the
balkan
state

nor
was
this
in
germani
s
interest
alon

but
also
in
that
of
the
balkan
peopl
themselv


and
none
but
our
jew
ridden
democracies

which
can
think
onli
in
terms
of
capitalism

can
maintain
that
if
one
state
delivers
machineri
to
another
state
it
therebi
dominates
that
other
state

in
actual
fact
such
domination

if
it
occurs

can
be
onli
a
reciprocal
domination


it
is
presum
easier
to
be
without
machineri
than
without
food
and
raw
materi

consequ

the
partner
in
need
of
raw
materi
and
foodstuff
would
appear
to
be
more
tie
down
than
the
recipi
of
industri
product

in
this
transaction
there
was
neither
conqueror
nor
conquered

there
were
onli
partners


the
german
reich
of
the
nation
socialist
revolut
has
pride
itself
on
be
a
fair
and
decent
partner

offer
in
exchang
high
qualiti
product
instead
of
worthless
democrat
paper
money

for
these
reason
the
reich
was
interest
in
onli
one
thing
if

inde

there
was
ani
question
of
polit
interest

name

in
see
that
intern
the
busi
partner
was
firm
establish
on
a
sound
and
healthi
basi


the
application
of
this
idea
led
in
fact
not
onli
to
increasing
prosperiti
in
these
countries
but
also
to
the
beginning
of
mutual
confidence

all
the
greater

howev

becam
the
endeavor
of
that
world
incendiari

churchil

to
put
an
end
to
this
peac
develop
and
by
shameless
impos
upon
these
state
utter
worthless
british
guarante
and
promis
of
assist
to
introduc
into
this
peaceabl
european
territori
element
of
unrest

uncertainti

distrust
and

final

conflict


origin

rumania
was
first
won
over
by
these
guarante
and
later

of
cours

greec

it
has

meanwhil

probabl
been
suffici
demonstr
that
he
had
absolut
no
power
of
ani
kind
to
provid
real
help
and
that
these
guarante
were
mere
intend
to
rope
these
state
in
to
follow
the
danger
trend
of
filthi
british
polit


rumania
has
had
to
pai
bitterli
for
the
guarantees

which
were
calculated
to
estrange
her
from
the
axis
powers


greec

which
least
of
all
requir
such
a
guarante

was
offer
her
share
to
link
her
destini
to
that
of
the
countri
that
provid
her
king
with
cash
and
order


even
todai
i
feel
that
i
must

as
i
believe
in
the
interest
of
historical
accuraci

distinguish
between
the
greek
people
and
that
thin
top
layer
of
corrupt
leaders
who

inspired
by
a
king
who
had
no
eyes
for
the
duti
of
true
leadership

preferred
instead
to
further
the
aims
of
british
war
politics

to
me
this
is
a
subject
of
profound
regret


germani

with
the
faint
hope
of
still
be
abl
to
contribut
in
some
way
to
a
solut
of
the
problem

had
not
sever
relat
with
greec

but
even
then
i
was
bound
in
duti
to
point
out
befor
the
whole
world
that
we
would
not
tacit
allow
a
reviv
of
the
old
salonika
scheme
of
the
great
war


unfortun

my
warn
was
not
taken
serious
enough

that
we
were
determin

if
the
british
tri
to
gain
anoth
foothold
in
europ

to
drive
them
back
into
the
sea
was
not
taken
serious
enough


the
result
was
that
the
british
began
in
an
increas
degre
to
establish
base
for
the
format
of
a
new
salonika
armi

they
began
by
lay
out
airdrom
and
by
establish
the
necessari
ground
organ
in
the
firm
convict
that
the
occup
of
the
airdrom
themselv
could
afterward
be
carri
out
veri
speedili


final
a
continu
stream
of
transport
brought
equip
for
an
armi
which

accord
to
mr

churchil
s
idea
and
plan

was
to
be
land
in
greec

as
i
have
said

alreadi
we
were
awar
of
this

for
month
we
watch
this
entir
strang
procedur
with
attent

if
with
restraint


the
revers
suffer
by
the
italian
armi
in
north
africa

owe
to
a
certain
materi
inferior
of
their
tank
and
anti
tank
gun

final
led
mr

churchil
to
believ
that
the
time
was
ripe
to
transfer
the
theater
of
war
from
libya
to
greec

he
order
the
transport
of
the
remain
tank
and
of
the
infantri
divis

compos
main
of
anzac

and
was
convinc
that
he
could
now
complet
his
scheme

which
was
to
set
the
balkan
aflam


thus
did
mr

churchill
commit
one
of
the
greatest
strategic
blunders
of
this
war

as
soon
as
there
could
be
no
further
doubt
regard
britain
s
intent
of
gain
a
foothold
in
the
balkan

i
took
the
necessari
step


germani

by
keep
pace
with
these
move

assembl
the
necessari
forc
for
the
purpos
of
counteract
ani
possibl
trick
of
that
gentleman

in
this
connect
i
must
state
categor
that
this
action
was
not
direct
against
greec


the
duce
did
not
even
request
me
to
place
one
singl
german
divis
at
his
dispos
for
this
purpos

he
was
convinc
that
with
the
advent
of
good
weather
his
stand
against
greec
would
have
been
brought
to
a
success
conclus

i
was
of
the
same
opinion


the
concentr
of
german
forc
was
therefor
not
made
for
the
purpos
of
assist
the
italian
against
greec

it
was
a
precautionari
measur
against
the
british
attempt
under
cover
of
the
clamor
caus
by
the
italo
greek
war
to
intrench
themselv
secret
in
the
balkan
in

to
forc

this

with

nevertheless

the

who

so

felt
no

toward

turkey

the

weigh

just

the

in

herr

our

submit
to
the

propos
that
were
so
outstand

so

that
at

even
the
yugoslav
state
of
that
time
seem
to
becom
increas
eager
for
such
close
co

germani
had
no
intent
of
start
a

in
the
balkan

on
the
contrari

it
was
our
honest
intent
as
far
as
possibl
to
contribut
to
a
settlement
of

with

by

that
would
be

the

not

lent
his

thus
it

possibl

which
made
no

thus
on

of

a

was
sign
in

that
offer
the

the
greatest

on

it

almost
eight
year
of

had
receiv

also
becaus
i
believ
that
perhap
at

german
intervent

might
not

we

you

that
when

i
at

gave

to

to
treat
the

in
this

is
imposs

one
cannot
spent

mere
to
discov
that
this
treati
has
not

been
broken
overnight
but
also
that
it
has
been
answer
by
the
insult
of
the

by
the
threaten
of
his

by

god
knows

i
can
do
noth

protect
the

with

thank

are

i
made
my

all

who
had
alway

and
with

both

were
bound
to
regard
this

as

there
is
onli
one
way
of
character
that
campaign


noth
is
imposs
for
the
german
soldier

histor
justic

howev

oblig
me
to
say
that
of
the
oppon
that
have
taken
up

against

most
particularli
the
greek
soldiers

have
fought
with
the
greatest
braveri
and
contempt
of
death

they
onli
capitul
when
further
resist
becam
imposs
and
therefor
useless


but
i
am
now
compel
to
speak
of
the
enemi
who
is
the
main
caus
of
this
conflict

as
a
german
and
as
a
soldier
i
consid
it
unworthi
ever
to
revil
a
fallen
enemi

but
it
seem
to
me
to
be
necessari
to
defend
the
truth
from
the
wild
exagger
of
a
man
who
as
a
soldier
is
a
bad
politician
and
as
a
politician
is
an
equal
bad
soldier


mr

churchil

who
start
this
struggl

is
endeavor

as
with
regard
to
norway
or
dunkerqu

to
say
someth
that
sooner
or
later
might
perhap
he
twist
around
to
resembl
success

i
do
not
consid
that
honor
but
in
his
case
it
is
understand


the
gift
mr

churchil
possess
is
the
gift
to
lie
with
a
pious
express
on
his
face
and
to
distort
the
truth
until
final
glorious
victori
are
made
out
of
the
most
terribl
defeat


a
british
armi
of
60
000
to
70
000
men
land
in
greec

befor
the
catastroph
the
same
man
maintain

moreov

that
it
consist
of
240

men

the
object
of
this
armi
was
to
attack
germani
from
the
south

inflict
a
defeat
upon
her

and
from
this
point
as
in
1918
turn
the
tide
of
the
war


i
prophesi
more
correct
than
mr

churchil
in
my
last
speech

in
which
i
announc
that
wherev
the
british
might
set
foot
on
the
contin
they
would
be
attack
by
us
and
driven
into
the
sea


now

with
his
brazen
effronteri

he
assert
that
this
war
has
cost
us
75
000
live

he
caus
his
presum
not
overintellig
fellow
countrymen
to
be
inform
by
one
of
his
paid
creatur
that
the
british

after
have
slain

final

sheer
abhorr
of

the

elimin

what
the
world
did
not
deem
possibl
the
german

have
achiev

again

onli
a
few
week
later

churchil
thought
the
moment
right
to
make
a
renew
thrust
through
the
british
alli

franc
and
belgium

into
the
german
region
of
the
ruhr

the
victori
hour
of
our
soldier
on
the
west
front
began


it
is
alreadi

histori
how
the
german
armi
defeat
the
legion
of
capit
and
plutocraci

after
forti
five
day
this
campaign
in
the
west
was
equal
and
emphat
termin


then
churchil
concentr
the
strength
of
his
empire
against
our
alli

itali

in
africa

now
the
danger
has
also
been
ban
from
the
african
theater
of
the
war
through
the
co
oper
of
italian
and
german
unit


the
new
aim
of
the
british
warmong
now
consist
of
the
realiz
of
a
plan
that
they
had
alreadi
hatch
at
the
outbreak
of
the

and
onli
postpon
becaus
of
the
gigant
victori
of
the

the
memori
of
the

of
british
troop
at

in
the
cours
of
the
first

war
also
caught
littl
greec
in
the
spider
web
of
british
intrigu


i
have
repeat
warn
of
the
attempt
by
the
british
to
land
troop
in
southeastern
europ

and
i
have
said
that
this
constitut
a
threat
to
the
german
reich

unfortun
this
warn
went
unheed
by
the
yugoslav
nation

i
have
further
tri

alway
with
the
same
patienc

to
convinc
yugoslav
statesmen
of
the
absolut
necess
for
their
cooper
with
the
german
reich
for
restor
of
last
peac
and
order
within
yugoslavia


after
long
effort
we
final
succeed
in
secur
the
cooper
of
yugoslavia
by
it
adher
to
the
tripartit
pact
without
have
demand
anyth
whatsoev
of
the
yugoslav
nation
except
that
it
take
it
part
in
the
reconstruct
of
a
new
order
in
europ


at
this
point
the
crimin
usurp
of
the
new
belgrad
govern
took
the
power
of
the
state
unto
themselv

which
is
a
result
of
be
in
the
pay
of
churchil
and
britain

as
in
the
case
of
poland

this
new
belgrad
govern
has
mobil
decrepit
and
old
peopl
into
their
inner
cabinet

under
these
circumst
i
was
forc
immedi
to
recal
the

coloni

territori


member

employe
of
our

the

exact
as

poland

were
laid
in
ruin
by

innumer
german
nation
were
kidnap

attack
by
yugoslav
and
some
even
were

in
addit

yugoslavia
for
week
has
plan
a
general
mobil
of
it
armi
in
great
secreci

this
is
the
answer
to
my
eight
year
long
effort
to
bring
about
closer
co
oper
and
friendship
with
the
yugoslav
peopl

a
task
that
i
have
pursu
most
fastidi


when
british
divis
were
land
in
greec

just
as
in
world
war
day

the
serb
thought
the
time
was
ripe
for
take
advantag
of
the
situat
for
new
assassin
against
germani
and
her
alli


soldier
of
the
southeast
front

now
your
zero
hour
has
arriv

you
will
now
take
the
interest
of
the
german
reich
under
your
protect
as
your
comrad
did
a
year
ago
in
norway
and
on
the
west
front

you
will
do
just
as
well
on
the
southeast
front


in
do
this

your
duti

you
will
not
be
less
courag
than
the
men
of
those
german
divis
who
in
1915

on
the
same
balkan
soil

fought
so
victori

you
will
be
human
onli
in
those
place
where
the
enemi
is
human
toward
you

where
the
enemi
confront
you
with
utter
brutal
you
will
beat
them
back
with
the
same
weapon


the
fight
on
greek
soil
is
not
a
battl
against
the
greek
peopl

but
against
that
archenemi

england

which
is
again
tri
to
extend
the
war
far
into
the
southeast
balkan

the
same
as
he
tri
far
in
the
north
last
year

for
this
reason

on
this
veri
spot
in
the
balkan

we
shall
fight
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
our
alli
until
the
last
briton
has
found
his
dunkerqu
in
greec


if
ani
greek
support
this
british
cours

then
those
greek
will
fall
at
the
same
time
as
the
british


when
the
german
soldier
shall
have
prove
himself

shall
have
prove
that
he
is
capabl
of
beat
the
british
in
the
balkan

in
the
midst
of
snow
and
mountain

then
also
he
will
have
prove
that
he
can
beat
the
british
in
the
heat
of
the
desert
in
africa


howev

we
will
pursu
no
other
ultim
aim
than
to
win
freedom
for
our
german
peopl
and
to
secur
a
live
space
for
the
german
famili


the
prayer
and
thought

the
veri
life
of
all
german

are
again
in
the
heart
of
everi
german
soldier

for
the
second
time
we
enter
this
room
for
a
memori
servic
to
our
peopl

for
more
than
a
year
we
have
appreci
how
inadequ
are
word
to
express
the
nation
s
thank
to
it
hero

in
time
of
long
peac
the
memori
of
the
terribl
experi
of
war

out
of
which
rise
heroism

gradual
grow
dim

it
even
happen
that
a
whole
generat
know
noth
of
war
as
such
and
honor
it
hero
without
be
in
the
least
worthi
of
them


in
such
a
circumst
the
greatest
sacrific
of
man
is
acknowledg
with
superfici
phrase

there
is
even
danger
that

while
rememb
hero
of
time
past

the
men
of
the
present
regard
themselv
as
free
of
the
oblig
to
conduct
themselv
with
a
similar
spirit
of
heroism


but
if
the
german
peopl
in
the
year
1941
honor
it
hero

it
doe
so
at
a
time
and
under
circumst
that
give
it
a
right
to
hold
up
it
head
with
pride
as
it
pay
tribut
to
men
of
the
near
and
distant
past
who
sacrif
their
live
for
the
state


as
twelv
month
ago
in
this
consecr
hall
we
turn
our
thought
to
our
hero

there
lay
behind
us
the
thorough
success
begin
of
a
war
that
germani
did
not
want

but
that
was
forc
on
us
by
the
same
forc
that
were
respons
befor
in
histori
for
the
great
war
of
the
peopl
in
1914
to
1918


they
were
the
element
whose
goal
that
time
was
to
rob
the
german
nation
of
the
most
primit
right
of
life

who
in
the
year
of
the
versaill
dictat
rais
as
the
dogma
of
the
new
world
order
polit
enslav
and
econom
impot

and
now
are
oppos
to
the
reviv
of
our
peopl
with
the
same
hatr
with
which
they
onc
pursu
the
second
reich


in
complet
misjudg
of
the
situat

in
a
sad
fals
estim
of
their
own
and
germani
s
power

and
in
complet
ignor
of
the
will
and
determin
of
the
new
german
leadership

they
expect
a
second
crush
of
our
peopl
would
be
as
easi
as
the
first

the
fact
that
the

establish
firm
in

the
real

not
so
much
the

as
a
thin
stratum
of

financi
leadership
behind
which

wield
it
last
power

stood
intern
jewri
and
it
world
conspiraci
of
democraci
and
freemasonri


but
it
was
the
hope
of
these
respons
warmak
that
thrust
poland
forward
not
onli
to
attain
outward
justif
for
war
but
also
to
make
sure
in
advanc
that
poland
would
play
it
world
war
role
of
divid
german
strength


the
eighteen
day
campaign
in
poland
was
but
the
precipit
end
of
these
hope

under
these
circumst
the
german
peopl
were
abl
to
enter
the
year
1940
with
proud
confid

but
our
peopl
did
not
deceiv
themselv
as
to
the
year
lie
ahead

the
battl
in
the
west

which
remain
in
the
memori
of
everi
live
german
world
war
soldier
as
an
episod
of

without

had
to
be
decid


in
exact
knowledg
of
our
prepar

in

in
the
german

his

and

and
abil

befor
all
in

i
dare
on

1940

to
predict
that
the
battl
befor
us
would
end
in
the
most
glorious
victori
in
our

eight
week
later
this
battl
start


but
befor
the
defens
forc
struck
in
the
west

what
was
probabl
the
most
import
decis
of
the
war
was
taken

on
april
9

with
just
a
few
hour
to
spare

a

british
attempt
to

defens
power
in

at
dawn
on
may
10
this
perhap
most
danger
threat
to
our
militari
and
polit
posit
had
been
swept
asid

so
the
battl
to
a
decis
in
the
west
could
begin

it
follow
a
cours
previous
map
out


what
could
not
be
done
in
four
year
of
indescrib
sacrific
in
the
world
war
was
accomplish
in
a
few
week

the
crush
of
the
british
french
front


despit
the
conclus
of
the
guilti
british
prime
minist
of
that
time

the
year
1940
will
go
down
in
histori
as
one
of
the
most
decis
and
signific

becaus
in
this
year
there
was
a
shift
of
power
of
truli
histor
import

if
in
the
year
1918
we
could
have
had
onli
a
portion
of
this
success
the
world
war
would
have
been
won


today
german
forc
stand
throughout

strengthen
to
an
inconceiv
degre

readi
to
complet
joy
and
confid
what
was
begun
in
the
epoch
year
1940





the
german
peopl
have
recov
everyth
that
onc
was
sacrif
in
a
foolish
delus

so
today
we
can
recal
with
lighten
heart
the
sacrific
of
life
in
the
world
war

but
in
the
illustri
event
of
the
present
we
must
not
overlook
the
vast
spiritu
power
for
which
the
german
peopl
and
it
soldier
must
thank
the
heroism
of
their
ancestor


the
soldier
of
the
world
war
did
not
fall
in
vain

if
at
that
time
the
sacrific
was
not
immedi
crown
by
success

their
heroic
conduct
left
a
heritag
that
an
ever
worthi
german
generat
will
prize
with
deepest
emot
and
that
paralyz
the
memori
of
our
enemi


it
is
perhap
this
conscious
of
strength
that
enabl
the
german
peopl
today
to
achiev
such
great

the
peopl
feel
they
are
carri
out
the
will
of
heroic
ancestor


besid
the
dead
of
the
world
war
lie
now
the
fallen
in
continu
of
this
battl

and
again

as
then

the
son
of
our
peopl
lie
in
distant
place

in
the
sea

everywher
as
courag
fighter
for
their
great
german
home

it
is
the
same
german
man


be
it
in
world
war
work
or
in
the
present
fight
that
has
been
thrust
upon
us


who
risk
and
give
his
life
to
win
for
his
peopl
a
greater
futur

a
surer
peac

a
better
organ
and
human
comradeship
than
that
given
us
by
the
dictat
of
versaill


but
we
think
also
of
the
italian
soldier

who
as
alli
also
must
give
up
their
live
in
distant
part
of
the
world

their
ideal
and
object
are
the
same
as
our

the
world
is
not
here
for
a
few
peopl

and
an
order
base
etern
on
the
distinct
between
the
have
and
the
have
not
doe
not
exist
ani
more
becaus
the
have
not
have
determin
to
lay
claim
to
their
portion
of
god
s
earth


the
home
front

too

in
this
war
must
make
a
greater
sacrific
than
former

the
heroism
of
the
home
front
contribut
it
bit
to
the
most
decis
battl
in
german
histori

and
here
it
is
not
onli
the
man
who
must
show
the
power
of
his
resist
but
the
woman

too

the
nation
has
becom
a
battl
uniti

and
not
becaus
they
sought
this
fight
but
becaus
it
was
forc
on
them


behind
us
lie
a
winter
of
work

what
remain
to
be
improv
has
been
done

the
german
armi
is
now
the
strongest
militari
instrument
in
our
histori

in
the
month
of
this
winter
our
alli
bore
the
brunt
of
the
whole
power
of
the
british
attack

but
from
now
on
german
forc
again
will
resum
their
share
of
this
load


no
power
and
no
support
come
from
ani
part
of
the
world
can
chang
the
outcom
of
this
battl
in
ani
respect

england
will
fall

the
everlast
provid
will
not
give
victori
to
him
who

mere
with
the
object
of
rule
through
his
gold

is
will
to
spill
the
blood
of
men


germani
demand
noth
of
england
and
franc

all
the
reich
s
denunci

it
disarma
and
peac
suggest

were
vain

internat
financ
and
plutocraci
want
to
fight
this
war
to
the
finish

so
the
end
of
this
war
will
and
must
be
their
destruct

then
may
provid
find
a
way
to
lead
their
peopl

from
whom
the
chain
will
be
struck

into
a
better
order


when
england
and
franc
declar
this
war

england
immedi
began
a
fight
against
civil
life

to
the
blockad
of
the
world
war

that
war
against
women
and
children

it
ad
this
time
air
and
fire
war
against
peac
villag
and
citi

in
both
of
these
mode
of
war
england
will
be
defeat

the
air
war
that
churchil
start
will
destroy
not
germani
but
england
itself

just
so

the
blockad
will
not
strike
germani
but
it
inventor


while
the
come
of
winter
limit
battl
action
on
land

the
fight
in
the
air
and
on
the
sea
continu

the
heroism
of
submarin
and
ship
crew
goe
hand
in
hand
with
that
of
our
flier





so
we
enter
the
year
1941

cool
and
determin
to
end
what
start
the
year
befor

it
is
quit
immateri
what
part
of
the
earth
or
in
which
sea
or
in
what
air
space
our
german
soldier
fight

they
will
know
they
battl
for
fate
and
freedom
and
the
futur
of
our
peopl
forev


but
while
we
end
this
battl
victori
we
thank
our
hero
of
the
past

for
we
are
save
that
for
which
they
fell

germani

our

and
it
great

fellow

the
twenti
fourth
of
februari
is
alway

and
right
so

a
day
of
vivid
memori
for
us

on
this
date
and
from
this
veri
hall
began
the
movement
s
amaz
march
to
victori

which
bore
it
to
the
helm
of
the
reich

to
leadership
of
the
nation
and
it
destini

this
day
is
a
great
day
for
me
too


sure

it
is
seldom
that
a
polit
leader
can
stand
befor
the
same
band
of
follow
that
hail
his
first
great
public
appear
twenti
one
year
befor

and
repeat
the
same
program

seldom
can
a
man
proclaim
the
same
doctrin
and
put
them
into
practic
for
twenti
one
year
without
at
ani
time
have
had
to
relinquish
a
singl
part
of
his
origin
program

in
1920

when
we
met
for
the
first
time
in
this
hall

mani
of
you
must
have
ask
yourselv


dear
me

a
new

anoth
new

whi
do
we
want
a

don

thus
began
a
heroic
struggl

oppos
at
it
incept
by
near
all

nevertheless

the
essenti
object
of
the
movement
embrac
the
decis
element

its
clear
and
unambigu
aim
did
not
allow
the
movement
to
becom
the
tool
of
definit
and
limit
individu
interest

but
rais
it
abov
all
special
oblig
to
the
particular
oblig
of
serv
the
german
nation
in
it
entireti

of
safeguard
it
interest
regardless
of
momentari
dissens
or
confus
thought

thus

today

after
twenti
one
year

i
again
stand
befor
you





it
was
in
this
veri
town
that
i
began
my
struggl

my
polit
struggl
against
versaill

you
know
this

you
old
member
of
my
parti

how
often
did
i
speak
against
versaill

i
probabl
studi
this
treati
more
than
ani
other
man

to
this
day

i
have
not
forgotten
it

the
treati
could
not
be
abolish
by
humil

by
submiss

it
could
onli
be
abolish
by
relianc
upon
ourselv

by
the
strength
of
the
german
nation


the
day
of
bitter
struggl
necessarili
led
to
a
select
of
leader

when
today
i
appear
befor
the
nation
and
look
at
the
rank
that
surround
me

i
look
at
a
band
of
men

real
men
who
stand
for
someth

on
the
other
hand
when
i
regard
the
cabinet
of
my
oppon

i
can
onli
say


quit
incap
of
be
put
in
charg
even
of
one
of
my
smallest
group


hard
time
result
in
a
select
of
first
class
men
who
natur
caus
us
a
littl
anxieti
now
and
then

everybodi
who
is
worth
his
salt
is
sometim
difficult
to
handl

in
normal
time
it
is
not
alway
easi
to
get
diverg
element
to
work
togeth
instead
of
against
one
anoth

but
as
soon
as
danger
threaten

they
form
the
most
resolut
bodi
of
men

just
as
select
is
a
natur
consequ
of
war
and
bring
real
leader
to
the
fore
among
soldier

so
in
the
world
of
polit
select
is
the
outcom
of
struggl

it
was
a
result
of
this
slow
develop

this
etern
struggl
against
opposit

that
we
gradual
acquir
leader
with
whose
aid
we
can
today
achiev
anyth


when

on
the
other
hand

i
look
at
the
rest
of
the
world
i
am
oblig
to
say

they
were
simpli
asleep
while
this
miracl
was
take
place

even
today
they
refus
to
grasp
it

they
do
not
realiz
what
we
are

nor
do
they
realiz
what
they
themselv
are

they
go
on
like
a
figur
of

justic



with
blindfold
eye

they
reject
what
doe
not
suit
them

they
do
not
realiz
that
two
revolut
in
europ
have
creat
someth
new
and
tremend

we
are
fulli
conscious
of
the
fact
that
a
second
revolut

where
the
assumpt
of
power
occur
earlier
than
it
did
in
our
countri

proceed
parallel
with
our

the
fascist
revolut

too

yield
the
same
result

complet
ident
exist
between
our
two
revolut

not
onli
as
regard
aim

but
also
as
regard
method

over
and
abov
this
there
is
our
friendship

which
is
more
than
co
oper
with
a
purpos
in
view

nor
do
our
oppon
realiz
yet

that
onc
i
regard
a
man
as
my
friend

i
shall
stand
by
him











i
wish
to
display
no
falter
in
this
matter

there
cannot
be
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
bond
unit
the
two
revolut

and
especi
the
bond
unit
their
two
leader

is
indissolubl

and
that
one
will
alway
support
the
other

moreov

it
is
a
common
enemi
whom
we
shall
defeat


there
was
a
time
when
itali

fascist
itali

which
is
engag
in
the
same
struggl
as
we
are

which
is
shut
in
in
the
same
way
as
we
are

which
is
as
over
popul
as
we
are
and

up
until
now

has
been
given
no
better
chanc
of
live
than
we

kept
power
enemi
engag
in
our
behalf

numer
british
ship
were
engag
in
the
mediterranean

numer
british
airplan
were
engag
in
the
african
coloni

this
was
a
veri
good
thing
for
us

for

as
i
told
you
the
other
day

our
warfar
at
sea
is
just
begin

the
reason
for
this
is
that
we
first
want
to
train
new
crew
for
the
new
submarin
which
will
now
make
their
appear
on
the
scene

let
no
one
doubt
that
they
are
about
to
appear


just
two
hour
ago
i
receiv
a
communiqu
from
the
command
in
chief
of
the
navi
state
that
the
report
of
the
last
two
day
from
our
ship
and
submarin
on
the
high
sea
reveal
that
anoth
215
000
ton
have
been
sunk

that
of
this
total
190
000
ton
were
sunk
by
submarin
alon

and
that
this
figur
includ
a
singl
convoy
of
125
000
ton
which
was
destroy
yesterday


from
march
and
april
on

those
gentlemen
will
have
to
be
prepar
for
someth
veri
differ

they
will
see
whether
we
have
been
asleep
dure
the
winter

or
whether
we
have
made
good
use
of
our
time

dure
the
long
month
when
we
had
so
few
submarin
to
fight
our
battl

itali
kept
larg
forc
engag

it
doe
not
matter
to
us
whether
our
stuka
attack
british
ship
in
the
north
sea
or
in
the
mediterranean

the
result
is
alway
the
same

one
thing
is
certain

wherev
britain
touch
the
contin
she
will
immedi
have
to
reckon
with
us

and
wherev
british
ship
appear

our
submarin
will
attack
them
until
the
hour
of
decis
come

thus

except
for
germani

onli
itali
has
had
a
revolut
which

in
the
long
run

will
lead

must
lead
and
has
led
to
the
construct
of
a
new
nation
communiti


we
had
to
exercis
patienc
for
mani
a
long
year

and
i
can
onli
say

my
oppon
may
believ
that
they
can
terrifi
me
with
the
threat
of
time

but
i
have
learn
to
wait


and
i
have
never
been
idl
while
wait

we
had
to
wait
ten
year
after
1923
until
we
at
last
came
into
power

but
you
old
member
of
the
parti
know
that
we
accomplish
much
in
those
ten
year




we
were
never
in
the
habit
of
set
ourselv
a
limit
and
say

this
must
be
done
on
march
1

or
june
15

or
septemb
7





these
sharp
wit
journalist
who
are
now
in
england


they
are
no
longer
among
us


knew
all
about
it

now
they
said


august
13
is
the
turn
point

nation
social
is
done
for


august
13
came


and
nation
social
was
not
done
for

a
few
month
later
they
had
to
fix
a
new
date

final
came
januari
30

1933

then
they
said


well

now
they
have
made
their
mistak

they
have
gain
power

and
in
six
week
they
will
be
finish


three
month
at
the
most

three
month

and
that
will
be
the
end
of
them


the
six
week
and
the
three
month
pass

and
still
we
were
not
finish


and
so
they
kept
on
fix
new
date
for
our
downfal

and
now

in
wartim

they
are
do
exact
the
same
thing

and
whi
not

they
are
the
same
peopl

the
same
prophet

the
same
polit
divin
who
prophesi
the
futur
so
wonder
when
they
were
here

now
they
are
employ
as
assist
in
the
british
ministri
of
informat
and
the
british
foreign
office

they
alway
know
exact
that
on
such
and
such
a
date
the
german
will
be
finish

we
have
experienc
that
more
than
onc

you
all
know
what
they
said

i
need
onli
refer
to
the
celebr
utter
of
a
great
british
statesman
whom
you
in
munich
know
by
sight


mr

chamberlain

a
few
day
befor
april
9

of
last
year

he
said


thank
god

he
has
miss
the
bus


i
can
remind
you
of
anoth


the
british
command
in
chief


who
said


a
few
month
ago
i
was
afraid

now
i
am
afraid
no
longer

they
have
miss
their
opportun

besid

they
onli
have
young
general

that
is
their
mistak
and
their
misfortun

it
is
the
same
with
all
their
leader

they
have
lost
their
opportun

it
is
all
over


a
few
week
later
this
general
had
depart

probabl
he

too

was
too
young


today
they
are
do
exact
the
same
thing

they
alway
fix
final
date

in
the
autumn
they
said


if
they
don
t
land
now

all
is
well

in
the
spring
of
1941
britain
will
transfer
the
offens
to
the
contin


i
am
still
wait
for
the
british
offens

they
have
transfer
the
offens
elsewher

and
now

unfortun

we
must
run
after
them
wherev
they
happen
to
be

but
we
shall
find
them
wherev
they
run

and
we
shall
strike
them
where
they
are
most
vulner


thus

twenti
one
year
of
a
dauntless
struggl
for
our
movement
have
pass

after
thirteen
year
we
at
last
came
to
power

then
came
year
of
prepar
of
our
foreign
polici

of
gigant
work
at
home

you
know
that
it
is
all
an
exact
repetit
of
what
happen
in
the
parti

we
ask
noth
of
the
world
but
equal
right

just
as
we
ask
for
the
same
right
at
home

at
home
we
demand
the
right
to
meet
freeli

the
right
which
the
other
possess

we
demand
the
right
of
free
speech

the
same
right
as
a
parliamentari
parti
as
the
other
held

we
were
refus
and
persecut
with
terror

nevertheless

we
built
up
our
organ
and
won
the
day





of
cours

a
fundament
social
principl
was
necessari
to
achiev
this

it
is
today
no
longer
possibl
to
build
up
a
state
on
a
capitalist
basi

the
peopl
eventu
begin
to
stir

the
awaken
of
the
peopl
cannot
be
prevent
by
war

on
the
contrari

war
will
onli
hasten
it

such
state
will
be
ruin
by
financi
catastroph
which
will
destroy
the
foundat
of
their
own
former
financi
polici


the
gold
standard
will
not
emerg
victori
from
this
war

rather

the
nation
econom
system
will
conquer

and
these
will
carri
on
among
themselv
the
trade
that
is
necessari
for
them






in
this
respect
we
can
look
to
the
futur
with
confid

germani
is
an
immens
factor
in
world
economi

not
onli
as
a
produc
but
also
as
a
consum

we
certain
have
a
great
market
for
our
good

but
we
are
not
onli
seek
market

we
are
also
the
greatest
buyer

the
western
world
want

on
the
one
hand

to
live
upon
it
empir
and

on
the
other
hand

to
export
from
it
empir
as
well

that
is
imposs
becaus
in
the
long
run
the
nation
cannot
carri
on
one
side
trade

they
not
onli
have
to
buy

but
also
have
to
sell

they
can
sell
noth
to
these
empir

the
peopl
will
therefor
trade
with
us
in
the
futur

regardless
of
whether
this
happen
to
suit
certain
banker
or
not

therefor
we
will
not
establish
our
econom
polici
to
suit
the
concept
or
desir
of
banker
in
new
york
or
london





our
econom
polici

i
repeat

is
determin
sole
by
the
interest
of
the
german
peopl

from
this
principl
we
shall
never
depart

if
the
rest
of
the
world
say


war


i
can
onli
say


veri
well

i
do
not
want
war

but
no
one

howev
peaceabl

can
live
in
peac
if
his
neighbor
intend
to
forc
a
quarrel



i
am
not
one
of
those
who
see
such
a
war
come
and
start
whine
about
it

i
have
said
and
done
all
that
i
could

i
have
made
propos
after
propos
to
britain

likewis
to
franc

these
propos
were
alway
ridicul


reject
with
scorn

howev

when
i
saw
that
the
other
side
intend
to
fight

i
natur
did
that
which
as
a
nation
socialist
of
the
earli
day

i
did
onc
befor

i
forg
a
power
weapon
of
defens

and

just
as
of
old

i
proclaim
that
we
should
be
not
mere
strong
enough
to
stand
the
blow
of
other
but
strong
enough
to
deal
blow
in
return

i
built
up
the
german
arm
forc
as
a
militari
instrument
of
state
polici

so
that
if
war
were
inevit

these
forc
could
deliv
crush
blow


onli
a
few
day
ago

an
american
general
declar
befor
an
investig
committe
in
the
hous
of
repres
that
in
1936
churchil
had
person
assur
him


germani
is
becom
too
strong
for
us

she
must
be
destroy

and
i
will
do
everyth
in
my
power
to
bring
about
her
destruct



a
littl
later
than
1936

i
public
issu
a
warn
against
this
man
and
his

the
first
time

when

i
immedi
made
all
prepar
on
my
part
to

the
nation

and
you

my
old
parti
comrad

know
that
when
i
speak
it
is
not
a
mere
matter
of
word

for
i
act
accord

we
work
like
titan

the
armament
we
have
manufactur
in
the
past
few
year
are
realli
the
proudest
achiev
that
the
world
has
ever
seen

if
the
rest
of
the
world
tell
us


we
are
do
likewis
now


i
can
onli
repli


by
all
mean
do
so

for
i
have
alreadi
done
it

but
abov
all

don
t
tell
me
ani
of
your
tale

i
am
an
expert

a
specialist
in
rearmament

i
know
exact
what
can
be
made
from
steel
and
what
can
be
made
of
aluminum

i
know
what
achiev
can
be
expect
of
men
and
what
cannot
be
expect

your
tale
do
not
impress
me
in
the
least

i
enlist
the
strength
of
the
whole
german
nation
in
good
time
to
assist
in
our
arm
and

if
necessari

i
shall
enlist
that
of
half
europ

i
am
prepar
for
all
impend
conflict
and
consequ
face
them
calm


let
the
other
face
them
with
equal
calm


i
place
my
confid
in
the
best
armi
in
the
world

in
the
best
armi
which
the
german
nation
has
ever
possess

it
is
numer
strong

it
has
the
finest
weapon
and
is
better
led
than
ever
befor

we
have
a
bodi
of
young
leader
who
have
not
mere
prove
their
worth
in
the
present
war
but

i
can
well
say

have
cover
themselv
with
glori

wherev
we
look
today

we
see
a
bodyguard
of
chosen
men
to
whom
the
german
soldier
have
been
entrust

they
in
their
turn
are
the
leader
of
soldier
who
are
the
best
train
in
the
world

who
are
arm
with
the
finest
weapon
on
earth

behind
these
soldier
and
their
leader
stand
the
german
nation

the
whole
german
peopl

in
the
midst
of
this
peopl

form
it
veri
core

is
the
nation
socialist
movement
which
began
it
exist
in
this
room
twenti
one
year
ago



this
movement

the
like
of
which
doe
not
exist
in
the
democrat
countri

this
movement
whose
onli
pendant
is
fascism

nation
and
armi

parti
and
state
are
today
one
indivis
whole

no
power
in
the
world
can
loosen
what
is
so
firm
weld
togeth

onli
fool
can
imagin
that
the
year
1918
can
be
repeat


we
encount
the
same
idea
among
our
plutocrat
at
home

they

too

alway
hope
for
intern
disrupt

dissolut

civil
war
of
german
against
german

exact
the
same
idea
are
encount
today

they
say


there
will
be
a
revolut
in
germani
in
six
week


they
do
not
know
who
is
go
to
make
the
revolut

there
are
no
revolutionari
among
us

thoma
mann
and
other
like
him
went
to
england

some
have
alreadi
left
england
for
america

becaus
england
is
too
close
to
their
revolut
s
futur
field
of
oper

they
are
establish
their
headquart
far
from
their
futur
field
of
battl

nevertheless

they
assert
that
the
revolut
will
come

who
will
make
it

i
do
not
know

how
it
will
be
made

i
do
not
know
either

all
i
know
is
that
in
germani
there
can
be

at
the
most

onli
a
few
fool
who
might
think
of
revolut

and
that
they
are
all
behind
iron
bar


then
they
said


winter

gener
winter
is
come

and
he
will
forc
germani
to
her
knee


but

unfortun

the
german
peopl
are

winter
proof


german
histori
has
pass
through
i
do
not
know
how
mani
ten
of
thousand
of
winter

we
will
get
through
this
one

too


then
they
say


starvat
will
come


we
are
prepar
against
this

too

we
know
the
humanitarian
sentiment
of
our
british
oppon
and
so
have
made
our
prepar

i
believ
that
starvat
will
reach
them
befor
it
reach
us


then
they
said


time
is
on
our
side


but
time
is
onli
on
the
side
of
those
who
work

no
one
has
been
harder
at
work
than
we

of
that
i
can
assur
them

in
fact

all
these
vagu
hope
which
they
are
build
up
are
absolut
childish
and
ridicul





and
so

in
all
due
modesti

i
have
just
one
more
thing
to
say
to
my
oppon

i
have
taken
up
the
challeng
of
mani
democrat
adversari
and
up
to
now
i
have
alway
emerg
the
victor
from
the
conflict

i
do
not
believ
that
this
struggl
is
be
carri
on
under
differ
condit

that
is
to
say

the
relat
of
the
forc
involv
is
exact
the
same
as
befor

in
ani
case
i
am
grate
to
provid
that
this
struggl

have
becom
inevit

broke
out
in
my
lifetim
and
at
a
time
when
i
still
feel
young
and
vigor

just
now
i
am
feel
particular
vigor

spring
is
come

the
spring
which
we
all
welcom

the
season
is
approach
in
which
one
can
measur
forc

i
know
that

although
they
realiz
the
terribl
hardship
of
the
struggl

million
of
german
soldier
are
at
this
moment
think
exact
the
same
thing





if
fate
should
onc
more
call
us
to
the
battlefield

the
bless
of
provid
will
be
with
those
who
have
merit
it
by
year
of
hard
work

when
i
compar
myself
and
my
oppon
in
other
countri
in
the
light
of
histori

i
do
not
fear
the
verdict
on
our
respect
mental

who
are
these
egoist

each
one
of
them
mere
defend
the
interest
of
his
class

behind
them
all
stand
either
the
jew
or
their
own
moneybag

they
are
all
noth
but
money
grubber

live
on
the
profit
of
this
war

no
bless
can
come
of
that

i
oppos
these
peopl
mere
as
the
champion
of
my
countri

i
am
convinc
that
our
struggl
will
in
the
futur
be
bless
by
provid

as
it
has
been
bless
up
to
now


when
i
first
enter

twenti
one

i
was
an

i
had

my

the

i
look

nowaday

in

i
have
littl
time
for

and
in
the
second
place
i
believ
that
this
is
a
time
for
action
rather
than

we
are
involv
in
a
conflict
in
which
more
than
the
victori
of

is
at

it
is
rather
a

now

my
fellow
countrymen

this
world
has
not
been
so
divid
up
by
provid
or
almighti
god

this
alloc
has
been
made
by
man
himself

the
land
was
parcel
out
for
the
most
part
dure
the
last
300
year

that
is

dure
the
period
in
which

unfortun

the
german
peopl
were
helpless
and
torn
by
intern
dissens

split
up
into
hundr
of
small
state
in
consequ
of
the
treati
of
muenster
at
the
end
of
the
thirti
year

war

our
peopl
fritter
away
their
entir
strength
in
intern
strife




while
dure
this
period
the
german

notwithstand
their
particular
abil
among
the
peopl
of
western
europ

dissip
their
power
in
vain
intern
struggl

the
divis
of
the
world
proceed
beyond
their
border

it
was
not
by
treati
or
by
bind
agreement

but
exclus
by
the
use
of
forc
that
britain
forg
her
gigant
empire


the
second
peopl
that
fail
to
receiv
their
fair
share
in
this
distribut

name
the
italian

experienc
and
suffer
a
similar
fate

torn
by
intern
conflict

devoid
of
uniti

split
up
into
numer
small
state

this
peopl
also
dissip
all
their
energi
in
intern
strife

nor
was
itali
abl
to
obtain
even
the
natur
posit
in
the
mediterranean
which
was
her
due


thus
in
comparison
with
other

these
two
power
peopl
have
receiv
much
less
than
their
fair
share

the
object
might
be
rais

is
this
realli
of
decis
import


my
fellow
countrymen

man
doe
not
exist
on
theori
and
phrase

on
declar
or
on
system
of
polit
philosophi

he
live
on
what
he
can
gain
from
the
soil
by
his
own
labor
in
the
form
of
food
and
raw
materi

this
is
what
he
can
eat

this
is
what
he
can
use
for
manufactur
and
product

if
a
man
s
own
live
condit
offer
him
too
littl

his
life
will
be
wretch

we
see
that
within
the
countri
themselv

fruit
area
afford
better
live
condit
than
poor
barren
land

in
the
one
case
there
are
flourish
villag

in
the
other
poverti
stricken
communiti

a
man
may
live
in
a
stoni
desert
or
in
a
fruit
land
of
plenti

this
handicap
can
never
be
fulli
overcom
by
theori

nor
even
by
the
will
to
work


we
see
that
the
primari
caus
for
the
exist
tension
lie
in
the
unfair
distribut
of
the
rich
of
the
earth

and
it
is
onli
natur
that
evolut
follow
the
same
rule
in
the
larger
framework
as
it
doe
in
the
case
of
individu

just
as
the
tension
exist
between
rich
and
poor
within
a
countri
must
be
compens
for
either
by
reason
or
often
if
reason
fail

by
forc

so
in
the
life
of
a
nation
one
cannot
claim
everyth
and
leav
noth
to
other





the
great
task
which
i
set
myself
in
intern
affair
was
to
bring
reason
to
bear
on
the
problem

to
elimin
danger
tension
by
invok
the
common
sens
of
all

to
bridg
the
gulf
between
excess
rich
and
excess
poverti

i
recogn

of
cours

that
such
process
cannot
be
consumm
overnight

it
is
alway
prefer
to
bring
togeth
wide
separ
class
gradual
and
by
the
exercis
of
reason

rather
than
to
resort
to
a
solut
base
on
forc






therefor

the
right
to
live
is
at
the
same
time
a
just
claim
to
the
soil
which
alon
is
the
sourc
of
life

when
unreason
threaten
to
choke
their
develop

nation
fought
for
this
sacr
claim

no
other
cours
was
open
to
them
and
they
realiz
that
even
bloodsh
and
sacrific
are
better
than
the
gradual
extinct
of
a
nation

thus

at
the
begin
of
our
nation
socialist
revolut
in
1933

we
set
forth
two
demand

the
first
of
these
was
the
unif
of
our
peopl

for
without
this
unif
it
would
not
have
been
possibl
to
mobil
the
forc
requir
to
formul
and

particular

to
secur
germani
s
essenti
claim








for
us

therefor

nation
uniti
was
one
of
the
essenti
condit
if
we
were
to
co
ordin
the
power
inher
in
the
german
nation
proper

to
make
the
german
peopl
conscious
of
their
own
great

realiz
their
strength

recogn
and
present
their
vital
claim

and
seek
nation
uniti
by
an
appeal
to
reason


i
know
that
i
have
not
been
success
everywher

for
near
fifteen
year
of
my
struggl
i
was
the
target
of
two
oppos
side

one
side
reproach
me


you
want
to
drag
us
who
belong
to
the
intelligentsia
and
to
the
upper
class
down
to
the
level
of
the
other

that
is
imposs

we
are
educ
peopl

in
addit
to
that

we
are
wealthi
and
cultur

we
cannot
accept
this



these
peopl
were
incap
of
listen
to
reason

even
today
there
are
some
who
cannot
be
convert

howev

on
the
whole
the
number
of
those
who
realiz
that
the
lack
of
uniti
in
our
nation
structur
would
sooner
or
later
lead
to
the
destruct
of
all
class
has
becom
greater
and
greater


i
also
met
with
opposit
from
the
other
side

they
said


we
have
our
class
conscious


howev

i
was
oblig
to
take
the
stand
that
in
the
exist
situat
we
could
not
afford
to
make
experi

it
certain
would
have
been
simpl
to
elimin
the
intelligentsia

such
a
process
could
be
carri
out
at
onc

but
we
would
have
to
wait
fifti
or
perhap
a
hundr
year
for
the
gap
to
refil


and
such
a
period
would
mean
the
destruct
of
the
nation

for
how
can
our
peopl

it
360
per
squar
mile

exist
at
all
if
they
do
not
employ
everi
ounc
of
brain
power
and
physic
strength
to
wrest
from
their
soil
what
they
need

this
distinguish
us
from
the
other

in
canada

for
exampl

there
are
2
6
person
per
squar
mile

in
other
countri
perhap
16

18

20
or
26
person

well

my
fellow
countrymen

no
matter
how
stupid
one
manag
one
s
affair
in
such
a
countri

a
decent
live
would
still
be
possibl


here
in
germani

howev

there
are
360
person
per
squar
mile

the
other
cannot
manag
with
26
person
per
squar
mile

but
we
must
manag
with
360

this
is
the
task
we
face

that
is
whi
i
express
this
view
in
1933


we
must
solv
these
problem
and

therefor

we
shall
solv
them


of
cours
that
was
not
easi

everyth
could
not
be
done
immedi

human
be
are
the
product
of
their
educ

and

unfortun

this
begin
practic
at
birth

infant
are
cloth
in
differ
way

after
this
has
been
go
on
for
centuri

someon
sudden
come
along
and
say




i
want
to
unwrap
the
child
and
remov
all
it
cloth
so
that
i
may
discov
it
true
natur



which
is

of
cours

the
same
in
everi
case

you
have
onli
creat
the
differ
by
the
extern
wrap

underneath
these
they
are
all
alik


howev

it
is
not
so
easi
to
do
this

everyon
resist
be
unwrap

everyon
wish
to
retain
the
habit
he
has
acquir
through
his
upbring

but
we
will
carri
out
our
task
just
the
same

we
have
enorm
patienc

i
know
that
what
has
been
done
for
three

four

or
five
centuri
cannot
be
undon
in
two

three

or
five
year

the
decis
point
is
to
make
a
start





it
has
been
a
tremend
task

the
establish
of
a
german
communiti
was
the
first
item
on
the
program
in
1933

the
second
item
was
the
elimin
of
foreign
oppress
as
express
in
the
treati
of
versaill

which
also
prevent
our
attain
nation
uniti

forbad
larg
section
of
our
peopl
to
unit

and
rob
us
of
our
possess
in
the
world

our
german
coloni


the
second
item
on
the
program
was

therefor

the
struggl
against
versaill

no
one
can
say
that
i
express
this
opinion
for
the
first
time
today

i
express
it

my
fellowcountrymen

in
the
day
follow
the
great
war
when

still
a
soldier

i
made
my
first
appear
in
the
polit
arena

my
first
address
was
a
speech
against
the
collaps

against
the
treati
of
versaill

and
for
the
re
establish
of
a
power
german
reich

that
was
the
begin
of
my
work

what
i
have
brought
about
sinc
then
doe
not
repres
a
new
aim
but
the
oldest
aim

it
is
the
primari
reason
for
the
conflict
in
which
we
find
ourselv
today

the
rest
of
the
world
did
not
want
our
inner
uniti

becaus
they
knew
that

onc
it
was
achiev

the
vital
claim
of
our
mass
could
be
realiz

they
want
to
maintain
the
dictat
of
versaill
in
which
they
saw
a
second
peac
of
westphalia

howev

there
is
still
anoth
reason

i
have
state
that
the
world
was
unequ
divid

american
observ
and
englishmen
have
found
a
wonder
express
for
this
fact

they
say
there
are
two
kind
of
peopl


the

have

and
the

have
not


we

the
british

are
the

have


it
is
a
fact
that
we
possess
sixteen
million
squar
mile

and
we
american
are
also

have


and
so
are
we
frenchmen

the
other


they
are
simpli
the

have
not


he
who
has
noth
receiv
noth

he
shall
remain
what
he
is

he
who
has
is
not
will
to
share
it


all
my
life
i
have
been
a

have
not


at
home
i
was
a

have
not


i
regard
myself
as
belong
to
them
and
have
alway
fought
exclus
for
them

i
defend
them
and

therefor

i
stand
befor
the
world
as
their
repres

i
shall
never
recogn
the
claim
of
the
other
to
that
which
they
have
taken
by
forc

under
no
circumst
can
i
acknowledg
this
claim
with
regard
to
that
which
has
been
taken
from
us

it
is
interest
to
examin
the
life
of
these
rich
peopl

in
this
anglo
french
world
there
exist

as
it
were

democraci

which
mean
the
rule
of
the
peopl
by
the
peopl

now
the
peopl
must
possess
some
mean
of
give
express
to
their
thought
or
their
wish

examin
this
problem
more
close

we
see
that
the
peopl
themselv
have
origin
no
convict
of
their
own

their
convict
are
form

of
cours

just
as
everywher
els

the
decis
question
is
who
enlighten
the
peopl

who
educ
them

in
those
countri

it
is
actual
capit
that
rule

that
is

noth
more
than
a
cliqu
of
a
few
hundr
men
who
possess
untold
wealth
and

as
a
consequ
of
the
peculiar
structur
of
their
nation
life

are
more
or
less
independ
and
free

they
say


here
we
have
liberti


by
this
they
mean

abov
all

an
uncontrol
economi

and
by
an
uncontrol
economi

the
freedom
not
onli
to
acquir
capit
but
to
make
absolut
free
use
of
it

that
mean
freedom
from
nation
control
or
control
by
the
peopl
both
in
the
acquisit
of
capit
and
in
it
employ

this
is
realli
what
they
mean
when
they
speak
of
liberti

these
capitalist
creat
their
own
press
and
then
speak
of
the

freedom
of
the
press



in
realiti

everi
one
of
the
newspap
has
a
master

and
in
everi
case
this
master
is
the
capitalist

the
owner

this

is
the
one
who

of
the

if
the
editor
tri
to
write
other
than
what
suit
the
master

he
is
oust
the
next
day

this
press

which
is
the
absolut
submiss
and
characterless
slave
of
the
owner

mold
public
opinion

public
opinion
thus
mobil
by
them
is

in
it
turn

split
up
into
polit
parti

the
differ
between
these
parti
is
as
small
as
it
former
was
in
germani

you
know
them

of
cours


the
old
parti

they
were
alway
one
and
the
same

in
britain
matter
are
usual
so
arrang
that
famili
are
divid
up

one
member
be
a
conserv

anoth
a
liber

and
a
third
belong
to
the
labor
parti

actualli

all
three
sit
togeth
as
member
of
the
famili

decid
upon
their
common
attitud
and
determin
it

a
further
point
is
that
the

elect
peopl

actual
form
a
communiti
which
oper
and
control
all
these
organ

for
this
reason

the
opposit
in
england
is
realli
alway
the
same

for
on
all
essenti
matter
in
which
the
opposit
has
to
make
itself
felt

the
parti
are
alway
in
agreement

they
have
one
and
the
same
convict
and
through
the
medium
of
the
press
mold
public
opinion
along
correspond
line

one
might
well
believ
that
in
these
countri
of
liberti
and
rich

the
peopl
must
possess
an
unlimit
degre
of
prosper

but
no

on
the
contrari

it
is
precis
in
these
countri
that
the
distress
of
the
mass
is
greater
than
anywher
els

such
is
the
case
in

rich
britain



she
control
sixteen
million
squar
mile

in
india

for
exampl

a
hundr
million
coloni
worker
with
a
wretch
standard
of
live
must
labor
for
her

one
might
think

perhap

that
at
least
in
england
itself
everi
person
must
have
his
share
of
these
rich

by
no
mean

in
that
countri
class

is
the
crassest
imagin

there
is
poverti


incred
poverti


on
the
one
side

and
equal
incred
wealth
on
the
other

they
have
not
solv
a
singl
problem

the
workmen
of
that
countri
which
possess
more
than
one
sixth
of
the
globe
and
of
the
world
s
natur
resourc
dwell
in
miseri

and
the
mass
of
the
peopl
are
poor
clad


in
a
countri
which
ought
to
have
more
than
enough
bread
and
everi
sort
of
fruit

we
find
million
of
the
lower
class
who
have
not
even
enough
to
fill
their
stomach

and
go
about
hungri

a
nation
which
could
provid
work
for
the
whole
world
must
acknowledg
the
fact
that
it
cannot
even
abolish
unemploy
at

for
decad
this

has
had
two

well

my
fellow

what
then
are
we
to
say
about
ourselv


it
is
self
evid
that
where
this
democraci
rule

the
peopl
as
such
are
not
taken
into
consider
at
all

the
onli
thing
that
matter
is
the
exist
of
a
few
hundr
gigant
capitalist
who
own
all
the
factori
and
their
stock
and

through
them

control
the
peopl

the
mass
of
the
peopl
do
not
interest
them
in
the

they
are
interest
in
them
just
as
were
our
bourgeoi
parti
in
former

onli
when

when
they
need

otherwis

the
life
of

is
a
matter
of
complet
indiffer

to
this
must
be
ad
the
differ
in

is
it
not
ludicr
to
hear
a

who

of

as

is
offici
paid
by

say


when
the

we
will
do
someth
in
social
respect



it
is
the
member
of
parliament
who
are
the
director
of
the
busi
concern


just
as
use
to
be
the
case
with

but
we
have
abolish
all
that

a

except

this
is
not

in

they
repli


that

i
can
well
believ
it

for

certain

but
whether
it
is
sacr
to
the

is
anoth
matter


the

as
a

i
do
not
consid
it
possibl
in

for

in

for

while
anoth
jump
into

onc
a

such

are
a

on

we

equal
oppos
the

that

today

when
a

we

howev

we
hope
to
make
it
imposs

i
could
continu
to

exampl
indefinit

the
fact
remain
that
two
world
are
face

with
one
anoth

our
oppon
are
quit
right
when
they
say


noth
can
reconcil
us
to
the
nation
socialist
world


how
could
a
narrow
mind
capitalist
ever
agre
to
my
principl

it
would
be
easier
for
the
devil
to
go
to
church
and
cross
himself
with
holi
water
than
for
these
peopl
to
comprehend
the
idea
which
are
accept
fact
to
us
today

but
we
have
solv
our
problem


to
take
anoth
instanc
where
we
are
condemn

they
claim
to
be
fight
for
the
mainten
of
the
gold
standard
as
the
currenc
basi

that
i
can
well
believ

for
the
gold
is
in
their
hand

we

too

onc
had
gold

but
it
was
stolen
and
extort
from
us

when
i
came
to
power

it
was
not
malic
which
made
me
abandon
the
gold
standard

germani
simpli
had
no
gold
left

consequ

quit
the
gold
standard
present
no
difficulti

for
it
is
alway
easi
to
part
with
what
one
doe
not

we
had
no
gold

we
had
no
foreign
exchang

they
had
all
been
stolen
and
extort
from
us
dure
the
previous
fifteen
year

but

my
fellow
countrymen

i
did
not
regret
it

for
we
have
construct
our
econom
system
on
a
wholli
differ
basi

in
our
eye

gold
is
not
of
valu
in
itself

it
is
onli
an
agent
by
which
nation
can
be
suppress
and
domin


when
i
took
over

i
had
onli
one
hope
on
which
to
build

name

the
effici

abil
of
the
german
nation
and
the
german
workingman

the
intellig
of
our
inventor

engin

technician

chemist

and
so
forth

i
built
on
the
strength
which
anim
our

one
simpl
question
face
me

are
we
to
perish
becaus
we
have
no

am
i
to
believ
in
a
phantom
which
spell
our
destruct

i
champion
the
opposit
opinion

even
though
we
have
no

we
have
capac
for
work


the
german
capac
for
work
is
our
gold
and
our
capit

and
with
this
gold
i
can
compet
success
with
ani
power
in
the
world

we
want
to
live
in

which
have
to
be

henc

the
worker
must
build
them

and
the
raw
materi
requir
must
be
procur
by

my
whole
econom
system
has
been
built
up
on
the
concept
of
work

we
have
solv
our
problem
while

amaz
enough

the
capitalist
countri
and
their
currenc
have
suffer
bankruptci


sterl
can
find
no

today

throw
it
at

our

stabl

german

this
we

this
we
owe
to
the
german

who
has
given
us
his

the
whole

has
been
solv
in
one

as
if
by
magic


my
dear
friend

if
i
had
state
public
eight
or
nine
year
ago


in
seven
or
eight
year
the
problem
of
how
to
provid
work
for
the
unemploy
will
be
solv

and
the
problem
then
will
be
where
to
find
worker


i
should
have
harm
my
caus

everi
one
would
have
declar


the
man
is
mad

it
is
useless
to
talk
to
him

much
less
to
support
him

nobodi
should
vote
for
him

he
is
a
fantast
creatur


today

howev

all
this
has
come
true

today

the
onli
question
for
us
is
where
to
find
worker

that

my
fellow
countrymen

is
the
bless
which
work
bring


work
alon
can
creat
new
work

money
cannot
creat
work

work
alon
can
creat
valu

valu
with
which
to
reward
those
who
work

the
work
of
one
man
make
it
possibl
for
anoth
to
live
and
continu
to
work

and
when
we
have
mobil
the
work
capac
of
our
peopl
to
it
utmost

each
individu
worker
will
receiv
more
and
more
of
the
world
s
good


we
have
incorpor
seven
million
unemploy
into
our
econom
system

we
have
transform
anoth
six
million
from
part
time
into
full
time
worker

we
are
even
work
overtim

and
all
this
is
paid
for
in
cash
in
reichsmark
which
maintain
their
valu
in
peacetim

in
wartim
we
had
to
ration
it
purchas
capac

not
in
order
to
devalu
it

but
simpli
to
earmark
a
portion
of
our
industri
for
war
product
to
guid
us
to
victori
in
the
struggl
for
the
futur
of
germani


my
fellow
countrymen

we
are
also
build
a
world
here

a
world
of
mutual
work

a
world
of
mutual
effort

and
a
world
of
mutual
anxieti
and
mutual
duti

it
did
not
surpris
me
that
other
countri
start
ration
onli
after
two

three

five

and
seven
month

and
in
some
case
onli
after
a
year

believ
me

in
all
these
countri

this
was
not
due
to
chanc
but
to
polici

mani
a
german
may
have
been
surpris
that
food
card
appear
on
the
first
morn
of
the
war

yet

there
are

of
cours

two
side
to
this
food
card
system

some
peopl
may
say


wouldn
t
it
be
better
to
exclud
this
or
that
commod
from
ration

what
use
are
a
few
gram
of
coffe
when
nobodi
get
much
anyway

without
ration

at
least
a
few
would
get
more


now
that
is
exact
what
we
want
to
avoid

we
want
to
avoid
one
person
have
more
of
the
most
vital
commod
than
anoth

there
are
other
thing


a
valuabl
paint

for
instanc

not
everybodi
is
in
a
posit
to
buy
a
titian

even
if
he
had
the
money

becaus
titian
paint
onli
a
few
pictur

onli
a
few
can
afford
his
work

this
or
that
man
can
buy
one
if
he
has
enough
money

he
spend
it

and
it
circul
through
the
countri

but
in
the
case
of
food

everybodi
must
be
serv
alik


the
other
countri
wait
to
see
how
thing
would
develop

the
question
was
ask


will
meat
be
ration


that
was
the
first
sound
of
a
warn

in
other
word


if
you
are
a
capitalist

cover
your
requir

buy
yourself
a
refriger
and
hoard
up
a
few
side
of
bacon




shall
we
ration
coffe

there
are
two
opinion
as
to
whether
it
should
be
ration
or
not

it
might
be
possibl
that
in
the
end
those
who
think
that
coffe
should
be
ration
might
triumph


they
devot
four
whole
week
to
the
discuss
and
everybodi
who
has
a
spark
of
egot


as
they
have
in
the
democraci


say
to
himself


aha

so
coffe
is
to
be
ration
in
the
near
futur

let
us
hoard
it


then

when
the
suppli
are
exhaust
themselv

it
is
at
last
ration


it
was
just
this
that
we
want
to
avoid

that
is
whi
in
order
to
ensur
equal
distribut

we
have
had
to
impos
certain
restrict
from
the
veri
start

and
we
are
not
well
dispos
toward
those
who
do
not
observ
regul


one
thing
is
certain

my
fellow
countrymen

all
in
all

we
have
today
a
state
with
a
differ
econom
and
polit
orient
from
that
of
the
western
democraci


well

it
must
now
be
made
possibl
for
the
british
worker
to
travel

it
is
remark
that
they
should
at
last
hit
upon
the
idea
that
travel
should
be
someth
not
for
millionair
alon

but
for
the
peopl
too

in
this
countri

the
problem
was
solv
some
time
ago

in
the
other
countri


as
is
shown
by
their
whole
econom
structur


the
selfish
of
a
relat
small
stratum
rule
under
the
mask
of
democraci

this
stratum
is
neither
check
nor
control
by
anyon


it
is
therefor
understand
if
an
englishman
say


we
do
not
want
our
world
to
be
subject
to
ani
sort
of
collaps


quit
so

the
english
know
full
well
that
their
empire
is
not
menac
by
us

but
they
say
quit
truth


if
the
idea
that
are
popular
in
germani
are
not
complet
elimin

they
might
becom
popular
among
our
own
peopl

and
that
is
the
danger

we
do
not
want
this


it
would
do
no
harm
if
they
did
becom
popular
there

but
these
peopl
are
just
as
narrow
mind
as
mani
onc
were
in
germani

in
this
respect
they
prefer
to
remain
bound
to
their
conserv
method

they
do
not
wish
to
depart
from
them

and
do
not
conceal
the
fact


they
say


the
german
method
do
not
suit
us
at
all



and
what
are
these
method

you
know

my
comrad

that
i
have
destroy
noth
in
germani

i
have
alway
proceed
veri
care

becaus
i
believ


as
i
have
alreadi
said


that
we
cannot
afford
to
wreck
anyth

i
am
proud
that
the
revolut
of
1933
was
brought
to
pass
without
break
a
singl
windowpan

nevertheless

we
have
wrought
enorm
chang


i
wish
to
put
befor
you
a
few
basic
fact

the
first
is
that
in
the
capitalist
democrat
world
the
most
import
principl
of
economi
is
that
the
peopl
exist
for
trade
and
industri

and
that
these
in
turn
exist
for
capit

we
have
revers
this
principl
by
make
capit
exist
for
trade
and
industri

and
trade
and
industri
exist
for
the
peopl

in
other
word

the
peopl
come
first

everyth
els
is
but
a
mean
to
this
end

when
an
econom
system
is
not
capabl
of
feed
and
cloth
a
peopl

then
it
is
bad

regardless
of
whether
a
few
hundr
peopl
say


as
far
as
i
am
concern
it
is
good

excel

my
dividend
are
splendid



howev

the
dividend
do
not
interest
me
at
all

here
we
have
drawn
the
line

they
may
then
retort


well

look
here

that
is
just
what
we
mean

you
jeopard
liberti



yes

certain

we
jeopard
the
liberti
to
profit
at
the
expens
of
the
communiti

and

if
necessari

we
even
abolish
it

british
capitalist

to
mention
onli
one
instanc

can
pocket
dividend
of
76

80

95

140

and
even
160
per
cent
from
their
armament
industri

natur
they
say


if
the
german
method
grow
apac
and
should
prove
victori

this
sort
of
thing
will
stop



they
are
perfect
right

i
should
never
toler
such
a
state
of
affair

in
my
eye

a
6
per
cent
dividend
is
suffici

even
from
this
6
per
cent
we
deduct
one
half
and

as
for
the
rest

we
must
have
definit
proof
that
it
is
invest
in
the
interest
of
the
countri
as
a
whole

in
other
word

no
individu
has
the
right
to
dispos
arbitrarili
of
money

we

that
if

it
would
not

be
the
end
of
our

the

of

85

we
remain
ever

fact


on
the

that
other

say


if

lose

our

wide
capitalist

will
collaps

for

it

if
the

that

what
will
happen
to

we

have
bought

our
whole

the

they
will
present
their

and
the
whole

will
be
overthrown



i
can
well
understand
that
they
declar


let
us
prevent
this
at
all
cost

it
must
be
prevent


they
can
see
exact
how
our
nation
has
been
reconstruct

you
see
it
clear

for
instanc

there
we
see
a
state
rule
by
a
numer
small
upper
class

they
send
their
son
to
their
own
school

to
eton

we
have
adolf
hitler
school
or
nation
polit
educ
establish

on
the

the
son
of
plutocrat

financi
magnat

on
the

the
children
of
the

etonian
and
harrovian
exclus
in

posit
over
there

in
this
countri

men
of
the
peopl
in
charg
of
the
state


these
are
the
two
world

i
grant
that
one
of
the
two
must
succumb

yes

one
or
the
other

but
if
we
were
to
succumb

the
german
peopl
would
succumb
with
us

if
the
other
were
to
succumb

i
am
convinc
that
the
nation
will
becom
free
for
the
first
time

we
are
not
fight
individu
englishmen
or
frenchmen

we
have
noth
against
them

for
year
i
proclaim
this
as
the
aim
of
my
foreign
polici

we
demand
noth
of
them

noth
at
all

when
they
start
the
war
they
could
not
say


we
are
do
so
becaus
the
german
ask
this
or
that
of
us


they
said

on
the
contrari


we
are
declar
war
on
you
becaus
the
german
system
of
govern
doe
not
suit
us

becaus
we
fear
it
might
spread
to
our
own
peopl


for
that
reason
they
are
carri
on
this
war

they
want
to
blast
the
german
nation
back
to
the
time
of
versaill

to
the
indescrib
miseri
of
those
day

but
they
have
made
a
great
mistak


if
in
this
war
everyth
point
to
the
fact
that
gold
is
fight
against
work

capit
against
peopl

and
reaction
against
the
progress
of
human

then
work

the
peopl

and
progress
will
be
victori

even
the
support
of
the
jewish
race
will
not
avail
the
other


i
have
seen
all
this
come
for
year

what
did
i
ask
of
the
other
world

noth
but
the
right
for
german
to
reunit
and
the
restor
of
all
that
had
been
taken
from
them


noth
which
would
have
meant
a
loss
to
the
other
nation

how
often
have
i
stretch
out
my
hand
to
them

ever
sinc
i
came
into
power

i
had
not
the
slightest
wish
to
rearm


for
what
do
armament
mean

they
absorb
so
much
labor

it
was
i
who
regard
work
as
be
of
decis
import

who
wish
to
employ
the
work
capac
of
germani
for
other
plan

i
think
the
news
is
alreadi
out
that

after
all

i
have
some
fair
import
plan
in
my
mind

vast
and
splendid
plan
for
my
peopl

it
is
my
ambit
to
make
the
german
peopl
rich
and
to
make
the
german
homeland
beauti

i
want
the
standard
of
live
of
the
individu
rais

i
want
us
to
have
the
most
beauti
and
the
finest
civil

i
should
like
the
theater


in
fact

the
whole
of
german
civil


to
benefit
all
the
peopl
and
not
to
exist
onli
for
the
upper
ten
thousand

as
is
the
case
in
england


the
plan
which
we
had
in
mind
were
tremend

and
i
need
worker
in
order
to
realiz
them

armament
onli
depriv
me
of
worker

i
made
propos
to
limit
armament

i
was
ridicul

the
onli
answer
i
receiv
was

no


i
propos
the
limit
of
certain
type
of
armament

that
was
refus

i
propos
that
airplan
should
be
altogeth
elimin
from
warfar

that
also
was
refus

i
suggest
that
bomber
should
be
limit

that
was
refus

they
said


that
is
just
how
we
wish
to
forc
our
regim
upon
you



i
am
not
a
man
who
doe
thing
by
halv

if
it
becom
necessari
for
me
to
defend
myself

i
defend
myself
with
unlimit
zeal

when
i
saw
that
the
same
old
warmong
of
the
world
war
in
britain
were
mobil
onc
more
against
the
great
new
german
reviv

i
realiz
that
this
struggl
would
have
to
be
fought
onc
more

that
the
other
side
did
not
want
peac


it
was
quit
obvious

who
was
i
befor
the
great
war

an
unknown

nameless
individu

what
was
i
dure
the
war

a
quit
inconspicu

ordinari
soldier

i
was
in
no
way
respons
for
the
great
war

howev

who
are
the
ruler
of
britain
today

they
are
the
same
peopl
who
were
warmong
befor
the
great
war

the
same
churchil
who
was
the
vilest
agit
among
them
dure
the
great
war

chamberlain

who
recent
die
and
who
at
that
time
agit
in
exact
the
same
way

it
was
the
whole
gang

member
of
the
same
group

who
believ
that
they
can
annihil
nation
with
the
blast
of
the
trumpet
of
jericho


the
old
spirit
have
onc
more
come
to
life

and
it
is
against
them
that
i
have
arm
the
german
peopl

i

too

had
convict

i
myself
serv
as
a
soldier
dure
the
great
war
and
know
what
it
mean
to
be
fire
at
by
other
without
be
abl
to
shoot
back

i
know
what
it
mean
not
to
have
ani
ammunit
or
to
have
too
littl

what
it
mean
alway
to
be
beaten
by
the
other
side

i
gain
my
wholeheart
faith
in
the
german
peopl
and
in
the
futur

dure
those
year

from
my
knowledg
of
the
german
soldier

of
the
ordinari
man
in
the
trench

he
was
the
great
hero
in
my
opinion

of
cours

the
other
class
also
did
everyth
they
could

but
there
was
a
differ


the
germani
of
that
time
certain
seem
quit
a
toler
countri
to
anybodi
live
at
home
amid
wealth
and
luxuri

one
could
have
his
share
of
everyth

of
cultur

of
the
pleasur
of
life

and
so
on

he
could
enjoy
german
art
and
mani
other
thing

he
could
travel
through
the
german
countrysid

he
could
visit
german
town
and
so
forth

what
more
could
he
wish
for

natur

he
defend
it
all


on
the
other
hand

howev

there
was
the
ordinari
common
soldier

this
unimport
proletarian

who
scarc
had
suffici
to
eat

who
alway
had
to
slave
for
his
exist

nevertheless
fought
at
the
front
like
a
hero
for
four
long
year

it
was
in
him
that
i
place
my
trust

and
it
is
with
his
help
that
i
won
back
confid
in
myself

when
the
other
had
lost
their
faith
in
germani

i
regain
mine

never
lose
sight
of
the
ordinari
man
in
the
street

i
knew
that
germani
could
not
perish


germani
will
not
perish
so
long
as
she
possess
such
men

i
have
also
seen
how
these
combat

these
soldier
again
and
again
face
an
enemi
who
could
annihil
them
simpli
by
his
superior
materi

i
was
not
of
the
opinion
at
that
time
that
the
british
were
person
superior
to
us

onli
a
madman
can
say
that
i
have
ever
had
ani
inferior
complex
with
respect
to
the
british

i
have
never
had
ani
such
feel
of
inferior


the
problem
of
the
individu
german
against
the
individu
englishman
did
not
present
itself
at
all
at
that
time

even
at
that
time
they
went
whine
round
the
whole
world
until
they
found
support

this
time
i
was
determin
to
make
prepar
throughout
the
world
to
extend
our
posit

and
second

to
arm
at
home
in
such
a
manner
that
the
german
soldier
would
no
longer
be
oblig
to
stand
alon
at
the
front

expos
to
superior
forc


the
troubl
has
come

i
did
everyth
human
possibl


go
almost
to
the
point
of
self
abas


to
avoid
it

i
repeat
made
offer
to
the
british

i
had
discuss
with
their
diplomat
here
and
entreat
them
to
be
sensibl

but
it
was
all
in
vain

they
want
war

and
they
made
no
secret
of
it

for
seven
year
churchil
had
been
say


i
want
war


now
he
has
got
it


it
was
regrett
to
me
that
nation
whom
i
wish
to
bring
togeth
and
who

in
my
opinion

could
have
cooper
to
such
good
purpos

should
now
be
at
war
with
one
anoth

but
these
gentlemen
are
aim
at
destroy
the
nation
socialist
state

at
disrupt
the
german
peopl
and
divid
them
again
into
their
compon
part

such
were
the
war
aim
they
proclaim
in
the
past
and
such
are
their
war
aim
today

howev

this
time
they
will
be
surpris

and
i
believ
that
they
have
alreadi
had
a
foretast
of
it


there
are
among
you

my
fellow
countrymen

mani
old
soldier
who
went
through
the
great
war
and
who
know
perfect
well
what
space
and
time
mean

mani
of
you
fought
in
the
east
dure
that
war

and
all
the
name
which
you
read
about
in
1939
were
still
quit
familiar
to
you

perhap
mani
of
you
march
in
bad
weather
or
under
the
burn
sun
at
that
time

the
road
were
endless

and
how
desper
was
the
struggl
for
everi
inch
of
ground

how
much
blood
it
cost
mere
to
advanc
slowli

mile
by
mile

think
of
the
pace
at
which
we
cover
these
distanc
this
time

eighteen
day

and
the
state
which
wish
to
cut
us
to
piec
at
the
gate
of
berlin
was
crush


then
came
the
british
attack
on
norway

as
a
matter
of
fact

i
was
told
by
those
englishmen
who
alway
know
everyth
that
we
had
slept
through
the
winter

one
great
statesman
even
assur
me
that
i
had
miss
the
bus

yet
we
arriv
just
in
time
to
get
into
it
befor
the
british

we
had
sudden
reawaken

in
a
few
day
we
made
sure
of
this

we
took
norwegian
posit
as
far
north
as
kirken

and
i
need
not
tell
you
that
no
one
will
take
the
soil
on
which
a
german
soldier
stand


and
then
they
want
to
be
clever
and
speedier
in
the
west


in
holland
and
belgium

it
led
to
an
offens
that
mani

especi
among
our
older
men

envisag
with
fear
and
anxieti

i
am
perfect
well
awar
of
what
mani
were
think
at
that
time

they
had
experienc
the
great
war
on
the
western
front

all
the
battl
in
flander

in
artoi

and
around
verdun

they
all
imagin


today
the
maginot
line
is
there

how
can
it
be
taken

above
all

how
much
blood
will
it
cost

what
sacrific
will
it
call
for

how
long
will
it
take


within
six
week
this
campaign
too

had
been
conclud


belgium

holland

and
franc
were
vanquish

the
channel
coast
was
occupi

our
batteri
were
brought
into
posit
there
and
our
base
establish

of
these
posit

too

do
i
say


no
power
in
the
world
can
drive
us
out
of
this
region
against
our
will




and
now
my
fellow
countrymen

let
us
think
of
the
sacrific

for
the
individu

they
are
veri
great

the
woman
who
has
lost
her
husband
has
lost
her
all

and
the
same
is
true
of
the
child
that
has
lost
it
father

the
mother
who
has
sacrif
her
child

and
the
betroth
or
the
sweetheart
who
have
been
part
from
love
one
never
to
see
them
again
have
all
made
great
sacrific

howev

if
we
add
all
these
loss
togeth
and
compar
them
with
the
sacrific
of
the
great
war

then


howev
great
they
may
be
for
the
individu


they
are
incompar
small

consid
that
we
have
not
near
so
mani
dead
as
germani
had
in
1870
71
in
the
struggl
against
franc

we
have
broken
the
ring
encircl
germani
by
these

the
number
of
wound
is
also
extrem
small

mere
a
fraction
of
what
was
expect


for
all
this

our
thank
are
due
to
our
magnific
armi

inspir
by
a
new
spirit
and
into
which
the
spirit
of
our
nation
communiti
has
also
penetr

the
armi
now
realli
know
for
what
it
is
fight

we
owe
thank
to
our
soldier
for
their
tremend
achiev

but
the
german
soldier
give
thank
to
you

the
munit
worker

for
forg
the
weapon
for
his
use

for
this
is
the
first
time
that
he
has
gone
into
battl
without
feel
that
he
was
inferior
to
the
enemi
in
number
or
that
his
weapon
were
of
poorer
qualiti

our
weapon
were
better
in
everi
respect


that
is
your
do

the
result
of
your
workmanship

of
your
industri

your
capac

your
devot

million
of
german
famili
still
have
their
breadwinn
today
and
will
have
them
in
the
futur

innumer
father
and
mother
still
have
their
son


and
their
thank
are
due
to
you

my
munit
worker

you
have
forg
for
them
the
weapon
with
which
they
were
abl
to
go
forward
to
victori

weapon
which
today
give
them
so
much
confid
that
everyon
know
we
are
not
onli
the
best
soldier
in
the
world
but
that
we
also
have
the
best
weapon
in
the
world

not
onli
is
this
true
today

it
will
be
more
so
in
the
futur


that
is
the
differ
between
today
and
the
great
war

but
not
onli
that

above
all

this
time
the
german
soldier
is
not
short
of
ammunit

i
do
not
know

my
fellow
countrymen

but
it
may
be
that
when
exact
calcul
are
made
after
the
war

peopl
will
perhap
say


sir

you
were
a
spendthrift

you
had
ammunit
made
which
was
never
use

it
is
still
lie
about


yes

my
fellow
countrymen

i
have
had
ammunit
made
becaus
i
went
through
the
great
war

becaus
i
wish
to
avoid
what
happen
then
and
becaus
shell
are
replac
and
bomb
are
replac
but
men
are
not


and
thus
the
problem
of
ammunit
in
this
struggl
was
no
problem
at
all

perhap
onli
a
suppli
problem

when
the
struggl
was
over
we
had
scarc
use
a
month
s
product

today
we
are
arm
for
ani
eventu

whatev
britain
may
do

everi
week
that
pass
britain
will
be
dealt
heavier
blow

and
if
she
wish
to
set
foot
anywher
on
the
contin
she
will
find
us
readi
onc
more

i
know
that
we
are
not
out
of
practic

i
hope
that
the
british
have
also
forgotten
noth


as
far
as
the
war
in
the
air
is
concern

this
too

i
hope
to
avert

we
accept
it

we
shall
fight
it
to
the
finish

i
did
not
want
it

i
alway
struggl
against
it

we
did
not
wage
such
a
war
dure
the
whole
of
the
polish
campaign

i
did
not
allow
ani
night
attack
to
be
carri
out

in
london
they
said


yes

becaus
you
couldn
t
fli
by
night



in
the
meantim

they
have
notic
whether
we
can
fli
by
night
or
not

natur

it
is
not
possibl
to
aim
so
well
at
night
and
i
want
to
attack
militari
object
onli

to
attack
at
the
front
onli

to
fight
against
soldier

not
against
women
and
children

that
is
whi
we
refrain
from
night
attack

we
did
not
use
this
method
in
franc

we
carri
out
no
night
attack
from
the
air

when
we
attack
pari

onli
the
munit
factori
were
our
object

our
airmen
aim
with
wonder
precis

anybodi
who
saw
it
could
convinc
himself
of
that


then
it
occur
to
that
great
strategist

churchil

to
commenc
unrestrict
war
from
the
air
by
night

he
began
it
in
freiburg
im
breisgau
and
has
continu
it

not
one
munit
plant
has
been
demolish

yet
accord
to
british
news
report

the
one
in
which
we
are
at
present
assembl
is
noth
but
a
mass
of
crater

they
have
not
even
caus
a
singl
munit
factori
to
ceas
product

on
the
other
hand

they
have
unfortun
hit
mani
famili

helpless
women
and
children

hospit
have
been
one
of
their
favorit
object

whi

it
is
inexplain

you
yourselv

here
in
berlin

know
how
often
they
have
bomb
our
hospit


veri
well

i
wait
for
a
month

becaus
i
thought
that
after
the
conclus
of
the
campaign
in
franc
the
british
would
give
up
this
method
of
warfar

i
was
mistaken

i
wait
for
a
second
month
and
a
third
month

if
bomb
were
to
be
drop
i
could
not
assum
the
respons
befor
the
german
peopl
of
allow
my
own
countrymen
to
be
destroy
while
spare
foreign

now

this
war

too

had
to
be
fought
to
it
end

and
it
is
be
fought

fought
with
all
the
determin

with
all
the
materi

with
all
the
mean
and
all
the
courag
at
our
dispos

the
time
for
the
decis
conflict
will
arriv

you
may
be
sure
it
will
take
place

howev

i
should
like
to
tell
these
gentlemen
one
thing

it
is
we
who
shall
determin
the
time
for
it

and
on
this
point
i
am
cautious

we
might
perhap
have
been
abl
to
attack
in
the
west
dure
the
autumn
of
last
year

but
i
want
to
wait
for
good
weather

and
i
think
it
was
worth
while
wait


we
ourselv
are
so
convinc
that
our
weapon
will
be
success
that
we
can
allow
ourselv
time

the
german
peopl
will
certain
hold
out

i
believ
that
they
will
be
grate
to
me
if
i
bide
my
time
and
thus
save
them
untold
sacrific


it
is
one
of
the
characterist
of
the
nation
socialist
state
that
even
in

at
time
when
it
is
not
absolut
necessari

it
is
spare
of
human
life

after
all

the
live
of
our
fellow
citizen
are
at
stake


in
the
campaign
in
poland
we
forbad
mani
attack
or
rapid
advanc

becaus
we
were
convinc
that
a
week
or
a
fortnight
later
the
problem
would
solv
itself


we
have
gain
mani
great
success
without
sacrif
a
singl
man

that
was
also
the
case
in
the
west

it
must
remain
so
in
the
futur

we
have
no
desir
to
gain
ani
success
or
to
make
ani
attack
for
the
sake
of
prestig

we
never
wish
to
act
except
in
accord
with
sober
militari
principl

what
has
to
happen
must
happen

we
wish
to
avoid
everyth
els

as
for
the
rest

all
of
us
hope
that
reason
will
again
be
victori
and
peac
will

the

must
realiz
one

howev

neither

i
state
on

1939

that

that

and
that
we
could
still
less
be
defeat
by
forc
of

the
moral
of
the

guarante
this


the
german
peopl
will
be
rich
reward
in
the
futur
for
all
that
they
are
do

when
we
have
won
this

it
will
not
have
been
won
by

or
by

or
by

have
spent
all

and
when
this
hardest

of

is
over
there
will
be
new
task
for

we
have
alreadi

all
of

have
but
one
aim

to
develop
still
further
the
great
german
state

to
make
that
great
german
nation
more
and
more
conscious
of
it
exist
and

at
the
same
time

to
give
it
everyth
which
make
life
worth
live


we
have
decid
to
break
down
to
an
ever
increas
degre
the
barrier
prevent
individu
from
develop
their
faculti
and
from
attain
their
just
due

we
are
firm
determin
to
build
up
a
social
state
which
must
and
shall
be
a
model
of
perfect
in
everi
sphere
of
life





when
this
war
is
end

germani
will
set
to
work
in
earnest

a
great

awake


will
sound
throughout
the

then
the

will
stop
manufactur
cannon
and
will
embark
on

and
the
new

of
reconstruct

then
we
shall
show
the
world
for

who
is
the

master

capit

out
of
this
work
will
grow
the

have
dream

it
will
be
the

she
will
provid
a

she
will

should
anyon
say
to

these
are
mere
fantast
dream

mere
vision


i
can
onli
repli
that
when
i
set
out
on
my
cours
in
1919
as
an
unknown

nameless
soldier
i
built
my
hope
of
the

upon
a
most
vivid

yet
all
has
come
true


what
i
am

is
noth

what
i
have
alreadi
accomplish
and
achiev

it
will
be

sooner
and
more
definit
than
everyth
alreadi

the
road
from
an
unknown
and
nameless
person
to
fuehrer
of
the
german

was
harder
than
will
be
the
way
from

in

the

and
on

until

was
not
due
to
their
prowess
in

but
onli
to
our
cool
think
and
our
sens
of
respons


i
forbad
the
sacrific
of
more
human
live
than
was
absolut
necessari

that
is
to

i

everyth
which
it

will
be
done
regardless

what

there
would

in

just

onli
that
in

i
thereupon
made
an

should
be
reserv

in

up

more

been
forc
to

they
were

often
without

when

in

the

they
use

went

for

look

alway
strive

attain

improv
in

of

it
was

howev

imposs

the

that
everi
german
attempt
therebi
to
secur
the
remov
of
these
intoler
condit
was
taken
by
the
polish
ruler
to
be
noth
more
than
a
sign
of
weak

if
not
of
stupid


when
the
polish
govern
proceed
in
a
thousand
way
gradual
to
subjug
danzig
as

i
endeavor

by

of
practic

to
secur
a

wherebi
danzig

in

of

could
be

alleg

that

is
a

the
propos
for
a

as
communic
to
the
polish
govern
in

1939

were
noth
but
the
suggest
and
the
idea
alreadi
discuss
long
ago
between
myself
and
polish
foreign
minist
beck

except
for
the
fact
that
in
the
spring
of
1939
i
thought
i
would
be
abl
to
facilit
the
accept
of
these
propos
by
the
polish
govern
in
the
face
of
their
own
public
opinion
by
the
offer
to
conced
to
them
an
equival


the
fact
that
the
polish
govern
at
that
time
refus
to
consid
a
discuss
of
these
propos
was
due
to
two
reason

for
one
thing

the
inflam
chauvinist
power
behind
the
govern
never
intend
to
solv
the
problem
of
danzig

but
on
the
contrari
alreadi
live
in
the
hope

expound
later
in
public

speech

of
acquir
territori
from
the
reich
far
beyond
the
bound
of
danzig

in
fact

they
hope
to
be
in
a
posit
to
attack
and
conquer



these
aim

far
from
stop

at
east
prussia

were
climax
by
a
flood
of
public
and
a
continu
sequenc
of
speech

in

to
the
incorpor

for
the
annex

minimum
of

and
final
even
the

was
describ
as
the

between

these
demand

which
today
may
appear
crazi
but
which
were
then
present
with
fanat
serious

were
base
in
a
simpli
ridicul

on

insult
which
germani
and
her
arm
forc
had
to
put
up
with
from
these
militari
dilettant
would
never
have
been
toler
by
ani
other
state

just
as
they
were
not
expect
from
ani
other
nation

no
french
or
english
general
would
ever
have
presum
to
express
a
judgment
of
the
german
arm
forc
similar
to
that
which
we
heard
read
from
the
polish
side
for
year

particular
sinc
march

1939

and
on
the
other
hand
no
german
general
would
have
spoken
in
that
manner
of
english

french
or
italian
soldier


a
great
deal
of
self
control
was
need
to
keep
calm
in
face
of
these
simpli
shameless
insult

in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
knew
that
the
german
arm
forc
could
destroy
and
sweep
away
the
whole
of
this
ridicul
state
and
it
armi
within
a
few
week


but
this
attitud

for
which
the
polish
leader
themselv
were
respons

was
the
fundament
reason
whi
the
polish
govern
refus
even
to
discuss
the
german
propos


another
reason
was
that
fatal
promis
of
guarante
given
to
the
state
which

although
not
menac
at
all

veri
rapid
becam
convinc
it
could
afford
to
challeng
a
great
power
without
risk
onc
it
was
assur
of
the
support
of
two
great

perhap
even
hope
this
way
to
lay
the

for

for

as
soon
as
poland
felt
certain
of
that
guarante

minor

had
to
suffer
what
amount
to
a

of

i
do
not

it
my

to
speak
of

of
the
ukrainian

or

popul

whose
interest
now
lie
in

hand
of

howev

i
do
feel
it
my
duti
to
speak
of
the
lot
of
those
helpless
thousand
of
german
who
carri
on
the
tradit
of
those
who
first
brought
cultur
to
that
countri
centuri
ago
and
whom
the
pole
now
began
to
oppress
and
drive
out

sinc
march

1939

they
had
been
victim
of
truli
satan
terror

how
mani
of
them
had
been
abduct
and
where
they
are
cannot
be
state
even
today


villag
with

left

in

an

sir

wrote
in
his
diplomat
report
to
the
english

that
the
outstand

of

were
cruelti
and
lack

sinc
that

this
cruelti
has
not

just
as
ten

this

it

all
this
led
to
an

to

it

the
german
propos
aim
at
a
last
minut
agreement
on
a

equit

were
answer
by
a
general
mobil

the
german
request
that
an

should
be

found
on
a
propos
made
by
great
britain

was
not
compli
with
and
on
the
second
day
was
answer
by
an
offens
declar


under
these
circumst
it
was
obvious
that
if
further
incurs
into
the
reich
s
territori
occur

germani
s
patienc
would
be
at
an
end

what
the

had
erron
interpret
as
weak
was
in
realiti
our
sens
of
respons
and
my
firm
determin
to
come
to
an
understand
if
that
at
all
was
possibl


sinc
they
believ
that
this
patienc
and
longsuff
was
a
sign
of
weak
which
would
allow
them
to
do
anyth

no
other
cours
remain
than
to
show
them
their
mistak
by
strike
back
with
the
weapon
which
they
themselv
had
use
for
year


under
these
blow
their
state
has
crumbl
to
piec
in
a
few
week
and
is
now
swept
from
the
earth

one
of
the
most
senseless
deed
perpetr
at
versaill
is
thus
a
thing
of
the
past


if
this
step
on
germani
s
part
has
result
in
a
communiti
of
interest
with
russia

that
is
due
not
onli
to
the
similar
of
the

affect
the
two

but
also
to
that
of
the
conclus
which
both
state
had
arriv
at
with

to
their
futur
relationship


in
my
speech
at
danzig
i
alreadi
declar
that
russia
was
organ
on
principl
which
differ
from
those
held
in
germani

howev

sinc
it
becam
clear
that
stalin
found
noth
in

soviet
principl
which
should
prevent
him
from

germani
see
no

whi
she
should
adopt
anoth
criterion

the
soviet

is
the
soviet

nation

germani
is

socialist
germani


but
one
thing
is
certain

from
the
moment
when
the

long
period
in

shown
that
the
inhabit
of
these
two

were
never
happier
than
when
they
live
in
friendship
with
each

the
great

which
onc
made
germani

was

it

easi

off

also
it

that

miscarri

the
extent
to

i
am
secur
these

modest


this
i
ask

if
forti
six
million
englishmen
claim
the
right
to
rule
over
forti
million
squar
kilomet
of
the

it
cannot
be
wrong
for
eighti
two
million
german
to
demand
the
right
to
live
on
800
000
squar
kilomet

to
till
their

and
to
follow
their

and

and
if
they
further
demand
the
restitut
of

coloni
possess
which

were
their

which
they
had
not
taken
away

honest
acquir

exchang
and
treati

moreov

in
all
my
demand

i
alway
first
tri
to
obtain
revis
by
way
of
negoti


i
did

it
is
true

refus
to
submit
the
question
of
german
vital
right
to
some
non
compet
intern
bodi
in
the
form
of
humbl
request

just
as
littl
as
i
suppos
that
great
britain
would
plead
for
respect
of
her
vital
interest

so
littl
ought
one
to
expect
the
same
of
nation
socialist
germani

i
have

howev

and
i
must
emphas
this
fact
most
solemn

limit
in
the
extrem
the
measur
of
these
revis
of
the
versaill
treati


notabl
in
all
those
case
where
i
did
not
see
ani
menac
to
the
natur

vital
interest
of
my
peopl

i
have
myself
advis
the
german
nation
to
hold
back

yet
these
eighti
million
peopl
must
live
somewher

there
exist
a
fact
that
not
even
the
versaill
treati
has
been
abl
to
destroy

although
it
has
in
the
most
unreason
manner
dissolv
state

torn

econom
connect

cut

etc


yet
the
peopl

the
live
substanc
of
flesh

has
remain
and
will
forev
remain
in
the
futur


it
cannot
be
deni
that
sinc
the
german
peopl
has
found
it
resurrect
through
nation
social

the
relat
exist
between
germani
and
the
surround
nation
has
been
clear
up
to
a
great
extent


the
uncertainti
that
today
is
weigh
down
the
common
life
of
nation
is
not
due
to
german
demand

but
to
the
malign
insinu
publish
in
the
so
call
democraci


the
german
demand
themselv
were
formul
in
a
veri
clear
and
precis
way

they
have

it
is
true

found
their
fulfil
not
thank
to
the
insight
of
the
leagu
of
nation
but
thank
to
the
dynam
of
natur
develop


the
aim
of
the
german
foreign
polici
as
pursu
by
me
has
never
been
other
than
to
guarante
the
exist


that
is
to
say

the
life


of
the
german
peopl

to
remov
the
injustic
and
nonsens
contain
in
a
treati
which
not
onli
destroy
germani
econom
but
has
drawn
the
victor
nation
into
disast
as
well


for
the
rest

howev

our
whole
work
of
rebuild
was
concern
with
the
home
affair
of
the
reich
and
no
countri
in
the
world
had
a
greater
long
for
peac
than
the
german
peopl

it
was
fortun
for
human
and
no
misfortun
at
all
that
i
succeed
in
remov
the
craziest

most
imposs
claus
of
the
versaill
treati
by
peac
method
and
without
compromis
foreign
statesmen
in
the
intern
polit
of
their
countri


that
some
detail
of
this
action
may
have
been
pain
to
certain
interest
parti
is
comprehens

but
the
merit
is
all
the
greater
for
the
fact
that
this
reorgan
was
brought
about
without
bloodsh
in
all
case
but
the
last
one


the
last
revis
of
this
treati
could
have
been
brought
about
in
exact
the
same
peac
way
had
not
two
circumst
i
have
mention
had
the
contrari
effect

that
is
chiefli
the
fault
of
those
who
not
onli
tool

no
pleasur
in
the
former
peac
revis

but
on
the
contrari
com

plain
of
the
fact
that
by
peac
method
a
new
central
europ
was
be
built
up

that
is
to
say

a
central
europ
that
was
abl
onc
more
to
give
it
inhabit
work
and
bread


as
i
have
alreadi
mention

it
was
one
of
the
aim
of
the
govern
of
the
reich
to
clear
up
the
relat
between
ourselv
and
our
neighbor

allow
me
to
point
out
some
fact
that
cannot
be
refut
by
the
scribbl
of
intern
press
liar


first

germani
has
conclud
non
aggress
pact
with
the
baltic
state

her
interest
there
are
of
an
exclus
econom
natur


second

in
former
time
germani
never
had
ani
conflict
of
interest
or
inde
litig
point
with
the
northern
state
and
she
has
none
today
either


third

germani
has
taken
no
step
in
regard
to
the
german
territori
hand
over
to
denmark
under
the
term
of
the
treati
of
versaill

she
has

on
the
contrari

establish
local
and
friend
relat
with
denmark

we
have
claim
no
revis

but
we
have
conclud
a
non
aggress
pact
with
denmark

our
relat
with
that
countri
are
thus
direct
toward
unswerv
loyal
and
friend
co
oper


fourth

holland

the
new
reich
has
endeavor
to
continu
the
tradit
friendship
with
holland

it
did
not
take
over
ani
differ
between
the
two

nor
did
it
creat
new
one

as
well
as

the
reich
has
put
forward
no
claim
which
might
in
ani
way
have
been
regard
as
a
threat
to
belgium


sixth

switzerland

germani
adopt
the
same
attitud
toward
switzerland

the
reich
govern
has
never
given
the
slightest
caus
for
doubt
regard
their
desir
to
establish
friend
relat
with
the
countri

moreov

they
themselv
have
never
brought
forward
ani

regard
the
relat
between
the
two
countri


seventh

immediat
after

fact

i
inform

that
the

in

with

countri
would
henceforth
be
regard
as
unalter
by
germani
and
that
we
wish
onli
to
live
in
peac
and
friendship
with
that
countri


eighth

the
bond
which
bind
us
to
hungari
is
old
and
tradit

one
of
close
and
sincer
friendship

in
this
instanc

too

our
frontier
are
unalter


ninth

slovakia
appeal
to
germani
of
her
own

for

in

with
her

as
a

her
independ
is
recogn
and
not
infring
upon
by
the
reich


tenth

howev

it
is
not
onli
with
these
state
but
also
with
the
great
power
that
germani
has
improv
and
settl
those
relat
which
to
a
certain
extent
had
been
advers
affect
by
the
treati
of
versaill


my
first
step
was
to
bring
about
an
alter
in
the
relat
between
itali
and
the
reich

the
exist
frontier
between
these
two
state
have
been
formal
recogn
as
unalter
by
both
countri

ani
possibl
of
a
clash
of
interest
of
a
territori
natur
has
been
remov

one
time
enemi
dure
the
world
war

they
have
in
the
meantim
becom
sincer
friend


establish
of
friend
relat
was
not
the
final
develop

but

in
the
period
which
follow

this
led
to
the
sign
of
a
cordial
pact
base
on
our
mutual
philosophi
and
polit
interest
which
has
prove
itself
to
be
an
import
factor
in
european
co
oper


my
chief
endeavor

howev

has
been
to
rid
our
relat
with
franc
of
all
trace
of
ill
will
and
render
them
toler
for
both
nation

i
onc
set
forth
with
the
utmost
clariti
germani
s
claim
in
this
domain
and
have
never
gone
back
on
that
declar

return
of
the
saar
territori
was
one
demand
which
i
regard
as
an
indispens
pre
condit
of
franco
german
understand


after
franc
herself
had
found
a
just
solut
of
this
problem

germani
had
no
further
claim
against
franc

no
such
claim
exist
ani
longer
and
no
such
claim
shall
ever
be
put
forward

that
is
to
say

i
have
refus
even
to
mention
the
problem
of
alsace
lorrain
not
becaus
i
was
forc
to
keep
silent

but
becaus
this
matter
doe
not
constitut
a
problem
which
could
ever
interfer
with
franco
german
relat


i
accept
the
decis
made
in
1919
and
refus
to
consid
ever
embark
upon
war
for
the
sake
of
a
question
which

compar
speak

is
of
slight
import
for
germani
s
vital
interest

but
which
is
certain
like
to
involv
everi
second
generat
in
a
dead
war
fear

franc
realiz
this


it
is
imposs
for
ani
french
statesman
to
get
up
and
declar
i
have
ever
made
ani
demand
upon
franc
the
fulfil
of
which
would
be
incompat
with
french
honor
or
french
interest

it
is

howev

true
that
instead
of
demand
i
have
alway
express
to
franc
my
desir
to
buri
forev
our
ancient
enmiti
and
bring
togeth
these
two
nation

both
of
which
have
such
glorious
past


among
the
german
peopl

i
have
done
my
utmost
to
erad
the
idea
of
everlast
enmiti
and
to
inculc
in
it
place
a
respect
for
the
great
achiev
of
the
french
nation
and
for
it
histori

just
as
everi
german
soldier
has
the
greatest
respect
for
the
feat
of
the
french
armi

i
have
devot
no
less
effort
to
the
achiev
of
an
anglo
german
understand

nay

more
than
that

of
an
anglo
german
friendship


at
no
time
and
in
no
place
have
i
ever
act
contrari
to
british
interest

unfortun
i
have
onli
too
often
been
forc
to
guard
against
instanc
of
british
interfer
in
german
affair

even
in
case
which
did
not
concern
great
britain
in
the
least

i
actual
consid
it
as
one
of
my
life
aim
to
reconcil
these
two
peopl

not
onli
through
mutual
understand
but
through
inner
sympathi


the
german
nation
has
glad
follow
my
lead
in
this
respect

if
my
endeavor
have
been
unsuccess

it
is
onli
becaus
of
an
animos
on
the
part
of
certain
british
statesmen
and
journalist

which
has
deepli
affect
me
person


they
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that


for
reason
which
are
unfathom
to
us


their
sole
aim
was
to
seiz
the
first
opportun
in
order
to
resum
the
fight
with
germani

the
fewer
reason
of
substanti
natur
these
men
have
for
their
scheme

the
more
they
attempt
to
motiv
their
action
with
empti
phrase
and
assert


but
i
believ
even
today
that
there
can
onli
he
real
peac
in
europ
and
throughout
the
world
if
germani
and
england
come
to
an
understand

becaus
of
this
convict
i
have
often
shown
the
way
to
an
understand

if
in
the
end
there
was
not
the
desir
result

it
was
realli
not
my
fault


final

i
now
also
attempt
to
bring
the
relat
between
the
reich
and
soviet
russia
to
a
normal
and

in
the
end

to
a
friend
basi

thank
to
a
similar
trend
of
thought
on
the
part
of
mr

stalin
these
endeavor
have
now
been
realiz

now
with
that
state
last
and
friend
relat
have
been
establish

the
effect
of
which
will
be
a
bless
to
both
nation


thus
the
revis
of
the
versaill
treati
carri
through
by
me
did
not
caus
ani
chao
in
europ

but
on
the
contrari
produc
the
prerequisit
of
clear

stabl
and
bearabl
condit


onli
those
who
detest
this
order
of
thing
in
europ
and
wish
for
disord
can
feel
hostil
to
these
action

if

howev

certain
peopl
think
themselv
oblig
to
reject
with
a
hypocrit
air
the
method
by
which
a
toler
order
of
thing
was
establish
in
central
europ

then
my
onli
repli
to
them
is
that
in
the
end
it
is
not
so
much
the
method
but
the
use
result
that
count


befor
i
came
into
power
central
europ

that
is
to
say
not
onli
germani
but
also
the
surround
state

was
sink
into
the
hopeless
distress
of
unemploy
and
product
had
decreas

involv
an
automat
jump
in
commod
consumpt

the
standard
of
live
went
down

distress
and
miseri
were
the
result


no
critic
foreign
statesman
can
deni
that
not
onli
in
the
old
reich
but
also
in
all
the
territori
now
merg
with
it

it
has
becom
possibl
to
remov
these
indic
of
decay
in
the
face
of
the
most
advers
condit


it
has
thus
been
prove
that
onli
as
an
entiti
is
this
central
european
space
capabl
of
exist
and
that
whoever
break
up
that
entiti
commit
a
crime
against
million
of
peopl


to
have
wipe
out
that
crime
doe
not
amount
to
a
breach
of
my
word

but
to
me
is
honor
itself

i
am
proud
of
it
as
my
deed
befor
histori


neither
the
german
peopl
nor
myself
has
taken
an
oath
on
the
treati
of
versaill

i
have
mere
taken
an
oath
on
the
welfar
of
my
peopl

who
gave
me
my
mandat
and
on
the
welfar
of
those
whom
destini
has
place
within
our
live
space

thus
insepar
bind
them
to
our
own
welfar


to
guarante
the
exist
and
thus
the
life
of
all
of
them
is
my
sole
concern


ani
attempt
to
critic

judg
or
reject
my
action
from
the
rostrum
of
intern
presumpt
has
no

leav
me
stone
cold

i
was

to
my

the

by
the
german
peopl

whose
attitud

me
is
onli

by
ani
such
attempt
at
critic
or
interfer

moreov

previous
to
each
singl
revis
i
have
put
forward
propos

i
had
attempt

by
mean
of
negoti

to
achiev
and
secur
what
was
absolut
indispens

in
a
certain
number
of
case
i
was
success

in
other
case

i
am
sorri
to
say

my
readi
to
negoti
and
perhap
also
the
small
extent
of
my
demand
and
the
modesti
of
my
propos
were
interpret
as
a
sign
of
weak
and
therefor
reject

nobodi
could
have
regret
this
more
than
i
did


there
are

howev

in
the
life
of
nation
certain
necess
which

if
they
are
not
brought
about
by
peac
method

must
be
realiz
by
forc

howev
regrett
this
appear

not
onli
to
the
life
of
the
individu
citizen
but
also
to
the
life
of
the
communiti

it
is
undeni
that
the
greater
interest
common
to
all
must
never
be
impair
by
the
stubborn
or
ill
will
of
individu
and
communiti

to
poland

too

i
made
the
most
moder
propos


they
were
not
onli
reject

but
on
the
contrari
brought
forth
the
general
mobil
of
that
state

for
which
reason
were
advanc
which
prove
conclus
exact
that
it
was
the
veri
modesti
of
my
propos
which
was
consid
a
confirm
of
my
weak

nay

even
of
my
fear

realli

such
an
experi
is
apt
to
make
anyon
shrink
from
ever
again
make
ani
reason
and
moder
propos


also
at
present
i
onc
more
read
in
certain
newspap
that
everi
attempt
to
bring
about
a
peac
settlement
of
relat
between
germani
on
the
one
hand
and
franc
and
england
on
the
other
was
doom
to
failur

and
that
ani
propos
in
that
direct
onli
prove
that
i

fill
with
apprehens

anticip
germani
s
collaps
and
that
i
onli
made
such
a
propos
out
of
cowardic

or
from
a
bad
conscienc


when

irrespect
of
all
this

i
have
express
my
idea
on
this
problem

i
am
prepar
to
appear
in
the
eye
of
these
peopl
as
a
coward
or
a
finish
man

i
can
afford
to
run
that
risk

becaus
the
judgment
to
be
pass
upon
me
by
histori
will
not

thank
god

be
written
by
these
miser
scribbler
but
is
establish
by
my

s
work

and
becaus
i
do
not
care
veri
much
about
ani
judgment
that
may
be
pass
upon
me
by
these
peopl
at
the

my
prestig
is
suffici
for
me
to
allow
myself
such
an
attitud

becaus
the
question
of
whether
my

are
actual
dictat
by

or
desper
will
in
ani

be
settl
by
the
futur

today
i
can
onli
regret
that
those
peopl

whose
bloodthirsti
cannot
have
enough
of
war

unfortun
are
not
where
the
war
is
actual
be
fought

and
never
were
at
such
place
where
peopl
were
shoot
it
out


i
can
veri
well
understand
that
there
are
interest
parti
who
profit
more
from
war
than
from
peac

and
i
also
understand
that
for
a
certain
varieti
of
intern
journalist
it
is
more
interest
to
report
on
war
than
on
peac
activ
or
cultur
achiev

which
they
are
incap
of
either
judg
or
understand

and
final
it
is
clear
to
me
that
there
is
a
certain
jewish
intern
capit
and
journal
that
has
no
feel
at
all
in
common
with
the
peopl
whose
interest
they
pretend
to
repres

but
who

like
herostr
of
old

regard
incendiar
as
the
greatest
success
of
their
live

but
there
is
still
anoth
reason
whi
i
feel
oblig
to
voic
my
opinion


when
read
certain
intern
press
public

or
listen
to
speech
of
various
capitalist
glorifi
of
war

i
consid
myself
entitl
to
speak
and
repli
in
the
name
of
those
who
are
forc
to
serv
as
the
live
substanc
for
the
mental
activ
of
these
formul
of
war
aim

that
live
substanc
to
which
i
myself
belong
as
an
unknown
soldier
for
more
than
four
year
dure
the
great
war


it
is

perhap

a
magnific
effect
when
a
statesman
or
a
journalist
stand
up
and
in
enthusiast
word
announc
the
necess
of
remov
the
regim
of
anoth
countri
in
the
name
of
democraci
or
someth
similar

practic
execut
of
these
glorious
slogan

howev

has
quit
a
differ
aspect


newspap
articl
are
be
written
today
which
are
sure
of
an
enthusiast
recept
by
the
distinguish
public

realiz
of
demand
therein
contain

howev

is
apt
to
arous
much
less
enthusiasm

i
shall
not
deal
with
the
power
of
judgment
or
the
gift
of
such
peopl

whatev
they
may
write
has
no
bear
on
the
real
natur
of
such
a
struggl


these
scribbler
announc
befor
the
polish
campaign
that
german
infantri
perhap
was
not
bad

but
that
tank
and
mechan
unit
in
general
were
inferior
and
would
be

sure
to
break
down
in
action


now

after
the
defeat
of
poland

the
same
peopl
brazen
assert
that
the
polish
armi
have
collaps
onli
becaus
o
german
tank
format
and
other
mechan
troop

but
that

on
the
other
hand

german
infantri
had
deterior
most
remark
and
had
got
the
worst
of
it
in
everi
clash
with
the
polish



in
this
fact


so
one
such
writer
actual
say


one
has
the
free
right
to
see
a
favor
symptom
for
the
cours
of
the
war
in
the
west

and
the
french
soldier
will
know
how
to
take
advantag
of
this



i
think
so

too

provid
he
has
read
that
articl
and
can
rememb
it
later
on

he
will
then
probabl
box
the
ear
of
these
militari
soothsay

but
unfortun
that
will
be
imposs

sinc
these
peopl
never
will
put
their
theori
on
inferior
of
the
german
infantri
to
a
person
test
on
the
battlefield

but
will
mere
describ
these
qualiti
from
their
editori
sanctum


six
week


let
us
say
fourteen
day


of
concentr
shellfir

and
these
war
propagandist
would
soon
think
differ

they
alway
are
talk
of
the
necess
of
world
polit

but
they
have
no
knowledg
of
militari
realiti


i
do
know
them
and
for
that
reason
i
consid
it
my
duti
to
speak
here

even
at
risk
of
the
warmong
again
see
in
my
speech
evid
of
my
anxieti
and
symptom
of
the
degre
of
my
despair


whi
should
this
war
in
the
west
be
fought

for
restor
of
poland

poland
of
the
versaill
treati
will
never
rise
again

this
is
guarante
by
two
of
the
largest
state
in
the
world

final
re
organ
of
this
territori
and
the
question
of
re
establish
of
the
polish
state
are
problem
which
will
not
be
solv
by
a
war
in
the
west
but
exclus
by
russia
on
the
one
hand
and
germani
on
the
other


furthermor

the
elimin
of
the
influenc
of
these
two
power
within
the
territori
concern
would
not
produc
a
new
state
but
utter
chao


the
problem
await
solut
there
will
never
be
solv
either
at
the
confer
tabl
or
in
editori
offic

but
by
the
work
of
decad

it
is
not
enough
that
a
few
statesmen
who
are
not
realli
concern
with
the
fate
of
the
peopl
affect
get
togeth
and
pass
resolut

it
is
necessari
that
someon
who
has
himself
a
share
in
the
life
of
these
territori
take
over
the
task
of
restor
realli
endur
condit
there

the
abil
of
the
western
democraci
to
restor
such
order
condit
has
at
least
in
recent
time
not
been
prove


the
exampl
of
palestin
show
it
would
be
better
to
concentr
on
the
task
at
hand
and
solv
these
in
a
reason
manner
instead
of
meddl
with
problem
which
lie
within
the
vital
sphere
of
interest
of
other
nation
and
could
certain
be
better
solv
by
them

at
ani
rate

germani
has
in
her
protector
of
bohemia
and
moravia
not
onli
establish
peac
and
order
but

abov
all

has
laid
the
foundat
for
a
new
econom
prosper
and
increas
understand
between
the
two
nation

england
still
has
much
to
accomplish
befor
she
can
point
to
similar
result
in
her
protector
in
palestin


one
also
realiz
that
it
would
be
senseless
to
annihil
million
of
men
and
to
destroy
properti
worth
million
in
order
to
reconstruct
a
state
which
at
it
veri
birth
was
term
an
abort
by
all
those
not
of
polish
extract


what
other
reason
exist

has
germani
made
ani
demand
of
england
which
might
threaten
the
british
empire
or
endang
it
exist

on
the
contrari

germani
has
made
no
such
demand
on
either
franc
or
england


but
if
this
war
is
realli
to
be
wage
onli
in
order
to
give
germani
a
new
regim

that
is
to
say

in
order
to
destroy
the
present
reich
onc
more
and
thus
to
creat
a
new
treati
of
versaill

then
million
of
human
live
will
be
sacrif
in
vain

for
neither
will
the
german
reich
go
to
piec
nor
will
a
second
treati
of
versaill
be
made

and
even
should
this
come
to
pass
after
three

four

or
even
eight
year
of
war
then
this
second
versaill
would
onc
more
becom
the
sourc
of
fresh
conflict
in
the
futur


in
ani
event

a
settlement
of
the
world
s
problem
carri
out
without
consider
of
the
vital
interest
of
it
most
power
nation
could
not
possibl

after
the
laps
of
from
five
to
ten
year

end
in
ani
other
way
than
that
attempt
made
twenti
year
ago
which
is
now
end

no

this
war
in
the
west
cannot
settl
ani
problem
except
perhap
the
ruin
financ
of
certain
armament
manufactur

newspap
owner

or
other
intern
war
profit


two
problem
are
ripe
for
discuss
today


first

the
settlement
of
the
problem
aris
from
the
disintegr
of
poland
and

second

the
problem
of
elimin
those
intern
difficulti
which
endang
the
polit
and
econom
exist
of
the
nation


what
then
are
the
aim
of
the
reich
govern
as
regard
the
adjust
of
condit
within
the
territori
to
the
west
of
the
german
soviet
line
of
demarc
which
has
been
recogn
as
germani
s
sphere
of
influenc


first

the
creation
of
a
reich
frontier
which

as
has
alreadi
been
emphas

shall
be
in
accord
with
exist
histor

ethnograph
and
econom
condit


second

the
disposit
of
the
entir
live
space
accord
to
the
various
nation

that
is
to
say

the
solut
of
the
problem
affect
the
minor
which
concern
not
onli
this
area
but
near
all
the
state
in
the
southwest
of
europ


third

in
this
connect

an
attempt
to
reach
a
solut
and
settlement
of
the
jewish
problem


fourth

reconstruct
of
transport
facil
and
econom
life
in
the
interest
of
all
those
live
in
this
area


fifth

a
guarante
for
the
secur
of
this
entir
territori
and
sixth

format
of
a
polish
state
so
constitut
and
govern
as
to
prevent
it
becom
onc
again
either
a
hotb
of
anti
german
activ
or
a
center
of
intrigu
against
germani
and
russia


in
addit
to
this

an
attempt
must
immedi
be
made
to
wipe
out
or
at
least
to
mitig
the
ill
effect
of
war

that
is
to
say

the
adopt
of
practic
measur
for
allevi
of
the
terribl
distress
prevail
there


these
problem
can

as
i
have
alreadi
emphas

perhap
be
discuss
but
never
solv
at
the
confer
tabl


if
europ
is
realli
sincer
in
her
desir
for
peac

then
the
state
in
europ
ought
to
be
grate
that
russia
and
germani
are
prepar
to
transform
this
hotb
into
a
zone
of
peac
develop
and
that
these
two
countri
will
assum
the
respons
and
bear
the
burden
inevit
involv


for
the
reich
this
project

sinc
it
cannot
be
undertaken
in
an
imperialist
spirit

is
a
task
which
will
take
fifti
to
a
hundr
year
to
perform


justif
for
this
activ
on
germani
s
part
lie
in
the
polit
organ
of
this
territori
as
well
as
in
it
econom
develop

in
the
long
run

of
cours

all
europ
will
benefit
from
it

second

and
in
my
opinion
by
far
the
most
import
task

is
the
creation
of
not
onli
a
belief
in

but
also
a
sens
of

european
secur


for
this
it
is
necessari
first
that
aim
in
the
foreign
polici
of
european
state
should
be
made
perfect
clear


as
far
as
germani
is
concern
the
reich
govern
is
readi
to
give
a
thorough
and
exhaust
exposit
of
the
aim
of
it
foreign
polici


in
so
do

they
begin
by
state
that
the
treati
of
versaill
is
now
regard
by
them
as
obsolet

in
other
word

that
the
govern
of
the
german
reich

and
with
them
the
whole
german
peopl

no
longer
see
caus
or
reason
for
ani
further
revis
of
the
treati

apart
from
the
demand
for
adequ
coloni
possess
just
due
to
the
reich

name

in
the
first
instanc

for
the
return
of
german
coloni


this
demand
for
coloni
is
base
not
onli
on
germani
s
histor
claim
to
german
coloni
but
abov
all
on
her
elementari
right
to
a
share
of
the
world
s
resourc
of
raw
materi

this
demand
doe
not
take
the
form
of
an
ultimatum

nor
is
it
a
demand
back
by
forc

but
a
demand
base
on
polit
justic
and
sane
econom
principl


second

the
demand
for
a
real
reviv
of
intern
econom
life

coupl
with
an
extens
of
trade
and
commerc

presuppos
a
reorgan
of
the
intern
econom
system

in
other
word

of
product
in
the
individu
state

in
order
to
facilit
the
exchang
of
good
thus
produc

howev

market
must
be
organ
and
a
final
currenc
regul
arriv
at
so
that
the
obstacl
in
the
way
of
unrestrict
trade
can
be
gradual
remov


third

the
most
import
condit

howev

for
a
real
reviv
of
econom
life
in
and
outsid
of
europ
is
the
establish
of
an
uncondit
guarante
peac
and
of
a
sens
of
secur
on
the
part
of
the
individu
nation


this
secur
will
not
onli
be
render
possibl
by
the
final
sanction
of
the
european
status

but
abov
all
by
the
reduct
of
armament
to
a
reason
and
econom
toler
level

an
essenti
part
of
this
necessari
sens
of
secur

howev

is
a
clear
definit
of
the
legitim
use
of
an
applic
of
certain
modern
armament
which
can

at
ani
given
moment

have
such
a
devast
effect
on
the
pulsat
life
of
everi
nation
and
henc
creat
a
perman
sens
of
insecur


in
my
previous
speech
in
the
reichstag
i
made
propos
with
this
end
in
view

at
that
time
they
were
reject

mayb
for
the
simpl
reason
that
they
were
made
by
me

i
believ

howev

that
a
sens
of
nation
secur
will
not
return
to
europ
until
clear
and
bind
intern
agreement
have
provid
a
comprehens
definit
of
the
legitim
and
illegitim
use
of
armament


a
geneva

onc
succeed
in
prohibit

in
civil
countri
at
least

the
kill
of

ill

of

war
against

etc


and
just
as
it
was
possibl
gradual
to
achiev
univers
observ
of

a

must
sure
be
found
to
regul

use

and
also
so
to
defin
contraband
that
war
will
lose
it
terribl
charact
of
conflict
wage
against
women
and
children
and
against
noncombat
in
general

a
grow
horror
of
certain
method
of
warfar
will
of
it
own
accord
lead
to
their
abolit
and
thus
they
will
becom
obsolet


in
the
war
with
poland
i
endeavor
to
restrict

warfar
to
object
of
so
call
militari
import

or
onli
to
employ
it
to
combat
activ
resist
at
a

point

but
it
must
sure
be
possibl
to
emul
the
red
cross
and
to
draw
up
some
univers
valid
intern

it
is
onli
when
this
is
achiev
that
peac
can
reign

particular
in

a
peac
which

uncontamin
by
suspicion
and
fear

will
provid
the
onli
possibl
condit
for

i
do
not
believ
that
there
is
ani
respons
statesman
in

who
doe
not
in

such

if
all

to

the

which
will
insur

all
a

in

of

such
a

not

without

this
is

without

it

imposs

it

continu

unthink

each

will
soon
demand
increas

perhap
the
day
will
come
when
franc
will
begin
to
bombard

demolish
saarbruccken

german
artilleri
will
in
turn
lay
mulhous
in
ruin

franc
will
retali
by
bombard
karlsruh
and
germani
in
her
turn
will
shell
strasbourg


then
the
french
artilleri
will
fire
at
freiburg

and
the
german

schlettstadt

long

no

it

today
there

one

howev

there

but
instead

mr

as
weak
or
cowardic
if
they
like

i
need
not
occupi
myself
with
what
they
think

i
make
these
statement
simpli
becaus
it
goe
without
say
that
i
wish
to
spare
my
own
peopl
this
suffer


if

howev

the
opinion
of
messr

churchil
and
follow
should
prevail

this
statement
will
have
been
my
last


then
we
shall
fight

neither
forc
of
arm
nor
laps
of
time
will
conquer
germani

there
never
will
be
anoth
novemb
1918
in
german
histori

it
is
infantil
to
hope
for
the
disintegr
of
our
peopl


mr

churchil
may
be
convinc
that
great
britain
will
win

i
do
not
doubt
for
a
singl
moment
that
germani
will
be
victori


destini
will
decid
who
is
right


one
thing
onli
is
certain

in
the
cours
of
world
histori

there
have
never
been
two
victor

but
veri
often
onli
loser

this
seem
to
me
to
have
been
the
case
in
the
last
war


may
those
peopl
and
their
leader
who
are
of
the
same
mind
now
make
their
repli

and
let
those
who
consid
war
to
be
the
better
solut
reject
my
outstretch
hand


as
fuehrer
of
the
german
peopl
and
chancellor
of
the
reich

i
can
thank
god
at
this
moment
that
he
has
so
wonder
bless
us
in
our
hard
struggl
for
what
is
our
right

and
beg
him
that
we
and
all
other
nation
may
find
the
right
way

so
that
not
onli
the
german
peopl
but
all
europ
may
onc
more
be
grant
the
bless
of
peac

my
district
leader

my
dear
danzig


not
onli
you
experi
this
moment
with
deepest
emot

nay

the
entir
german
nation
experi
it
with
you

and
i

too

am
awar
of
the
great
of
the
hour
when
i

for
the
first
time

tread
on
the
soil
which
german
settler
occupi
five
centuri
ago
and
which
for
five
centuri
was
german

and
which


thereof
you
may
rest
assur


will
remain
german






the
fact
that
a
provinc
was
torn
from
the
german
reich
and
that
other
german
territori
were
given
to
the
polish
state
was
explain
on
the
ground
of
nation
necess

later

plebiscit
everywher
show
that
no
one
wish
to
becom
a
part
of
the
polish
state


that
polish
state
which
aros
out
of
the
blood
of
countless
german
regiment

it
then
expand
at
the
expens
of
old
settlement
area
and
abov
all
at
the
expens
of
intellig
and
econom
possibl


one
thing
has
been
clear
prove
in
the
last
twenti
year

the
pole
who
had
not
found
that
cultur
also
were
not
abl
to
maintain
it

it
has
been
shown
again
that
onli
he
who
is
himself
cultur
creativ
can
perman
maintain
real
cultur
perform


thirti
year
would
have
been
suffici
to
reduc
again
to
barbar
those
territori
which
the
german

painstak
and
with
industri
and
thrift

had
save
from
barbar

everywher
trace
of
this
retrogress
and
decay
were
visibl


poland
itself
was
a

nation
state


that
veri
thing
had
been
creat
here
which
had
been
held
against
the
old
austrian
state

at
the
same
time
poland
was
never
a
democraci

one
veri
thin
anem
upper
class
here
rule
not
onli
foreign
nation
but
also
it
so
call
own
peopl


it
was
a
state
built
on
forc
and
govern
by
the
truncheon
of
the
polic
and
the
militari

the
fate
of
german
in
this
state
was
horribl

there
is
a
differ
whether
peopl
of
lower
cultur
valu
has
the
misfortun
to
be
govern
by
a
cultur
signific
peopl
or
whether
a
peopl
of
high
cultur
signific
has
forc
upon
it
the
tragic
fate
of
be
oppress
by
an
inferior


in
this
inferior
peopl
all
it
inferior
complex
will
be
compens
upon
a
higher
cultur
bear
peopl

this
peopl
will
be
horribl
and
barbar
mistreat
and
german
have
been
evid
of
this
fate
for
twenti
year


it
was

as
alreadi
emphas

tragic
and
pain

nevertheless

as
everywher
els

i
tri
to
find
a
solut
here
which
might
have
led
to
a
fair
adjust

i
have
tri
in
the
west
and
then
later
in
the
south
to
maintain
final
frontier
delin
in
order
thus
to
deliv
region
upon
region
from
uncertainti
and
assur
peac
and
justic
for
the
futur

i
made
the
greatest
effort
to
attain
the
same
thing
here
also






the
world

which
immedi
shed
tear
when
germani
expel
a
polish
jew
who
onli
a
few
decad
ago
came
to
germani

remain
dumb
and
deaf
toward
the
miseri
of
those
who

number
not
thousand
but
million

were
forc
to
leav
their
home
countri
on
account
of
versaill


that
is

if
these
unfortun
were
german

what
was
for
us
and
also
for
me
most
depress
was
the
fact
that
we
had
to
suffer
all
this
from
a
state
which
was
far
inferior
to
us

for

after
all

germani
is
a
great
power

even
though
madmen
believ
the
vital
right
of
a
great
nation
could
be
wipe
out
by
a
crazi
treati
or
by
dictat


germani
was
a
big
power
and
had
to
look
on
while
a
far
inferior
peopl
of
a
far
inferior
state
maltreat
these
german

there
were
two
especi
unbear
condit

first

this
citi
whose
german
charact
nobodi
could
deni
was
not
onli
prevent
from
return
to
the
reich
but
in
addit
an
attempt
was
made
to
polon
it
by
all
kind
of
devic

second

the
provinc

east
prussia

sever
from
the
german
reich
had
no
direct
contact
with
the
reich

but
traffic
with
this
provinc
was
depend
upon
all
kind
of
chicaneri
or
upon
the
good
will
of
this
polish
state


no
power
on
earth
would
have
born
this
condit
as
long
as
germani

i
do
not
know
what
england
would
have
said
about
a
similar
peac
solut
at
it
expens
or
how
america
or
franc
would
have
accept
it

i
attempt
to
find
a
solut


a
toler
solut


even
for
this
problem

i
submit
this
attempt
to
the
polish
ruler
in
the
form
of
verbal
propos

you
know
these
propos

they
were
more
than
moder





i
do
not
know
what
mental
condit
the
polish
govern
was
in
when
it
refus
these
propos

i
know

howev

that
million
of
german
sigh
with
relief

sinc
they
felt
i
had
gone
too
far

as
an
answer

poland
gave
the
order
for
the
first
mobil

thereupon
wild
terror
was
initi

and
my
request
to
the
polish
foreign
minist
to
visit
me
in
berlin
onc
more
to
discuss
these
question
was
re

fuse

instead
of
go
to
berlin

he
went
to
london

for
the
next
week
and
month
there
were
heighten
threat

threat
which
were
hard
bearabl
for
a
small
state
but
which
were
imposs
for
a
great
power
to
bear
for
ani
length
of
time


we
could
read
in
polish
public
that
the
issu
at
stake
was
not
danzig
but
the
problem
of
east
prussia

which
poland
was
to
incorpor
in
a
short
time

that
increas

other
polish
newspap
state
that
east
prussia
would
not
solv
the
problem

but
that
pomerania
must

under
all
circumst

come
to
poland


final
it
becam
question
in
poland
whether
the
oder
would
be
enough
as
a
boundari
or
whether
poland
s
natur
boundari
was
not
the
oder
but
the
elbe

it
was
debat
whether
our
armi
would
be
smash
befor
or
behind
berlin


the
polish
marshal

who
miser
desert
his
armi

said
that
he
would
hack
the
german
armi
to
piec

and
martyrdom
began
for
our
german
nation

ten
of
thousand
were
drag
off

mistreat

and
murder
in
the
vilest
fashion

sadist
beast
gave
vent
to
their
pervers
instinct

and
this
pious
democrat
world
watch
without
blink
an
eye


i
have
often
ask
myself

who
can
have
so
blind
poland

doe
anyon
realli
believ
that
the
german
nation
will
perman
stand
that
from
such
a
ridicul
state

doe
anyon
serious
believ
that

it
must
have
been
believ
becaus
certain
quarter
describ
it
as
possibl
to
the
pole

certain
quarter
which
general
warmong
have
occupi
decad
long

yes

hundr
of
year
long
and
which
they
occupi
even
today


these
quarter
declar
that
germani
was
not
even
to
be
consid
as
a
power

the
pole
were
told
that
they
would
easili
be
abl
to
resist
germani

and

go
a
step
further

assur
was
given
that
if
their
own
resist
was
not
enough
they
could
depend
on
the
resist
and
assist
of
other

the
guarante
was
given
which
put
it
into
the
hand
of
a
small
state
to
begin
a
war

or
again
perhap
not
to
do
so


for
these
men
poland

too

was
onli
a
mean
to
an
end

becaus
today
it
is
be
declar
quit
calm
that
poland
was
not
the
primari
thing

but
that
the
german
regim
is

i
alway
warn
against
these
men

you
will
recal
my
saarbruecken
and
wilhelmshaven
speech

in
both
these
speech
i
point
out
the
danger
that
in
a
certain
countri
such
men
could
rise
and
unmolest
preach
the
necess
of
war


herren
churchil

eden

duff
cooper

etc


i
point
out
how
danger
this
is

especi
in
a
countri
where
one
doe
not
know
whether
these
men
may
not
be
the
govern
in
a
short
time

i
was
then
told
that
that
would
never
happen

in
my
opinion
they
are
now
the
govern

it
happen
exact
as
i
then
foresaw

i
then
decid
for
the
first
time
to
warn
the
german
nation
against
them

but
i
also
have
left
no
doubt
that
germani

under
no
circumst

will
capitul
to
the
threat
or
coercion
of
these
peopl


on
account
of
this
answer
i
have
been
strong
attack

becaus
certain
practic
have
gradual
been
develop
in
democraci

name

in

war
may
be

there
foreign

and

may

sulli
becaus
there
reign
freedom
of

and
the

in
authoritarian
state

on
the
other
hand

one
may
not
defend
one
s
self
becaus
there
reign
disciplin


you
know

of
cours

of
those
august
day

i
believ
it
would
have
been
possibl
in
those
last
august
day

without
the
british
guarante
and
without
agit
by
these
warmong

to
have
reach
an
understand

at
a
certain
moment
england
herself
offer
to
bring
us
into
direct
discuss
with
poland

i
was
readi

of
cours
it
was
the
pole
who
did
not
come


i
came
to
berlin
with
my
govern
and
for
two
day
wait
and
wait

meanwhil

i
had
work
out
a
new
pro

posal

you
know
it

i
had
the
british
ambassador
inform
of
it
on
the
even
of
the
first
day

it
was
read
to
him
sentenc
by
sentenc
and
the
reich
foreign
minist
gave
him
a
supplementari
explan

then
came
the
next
day
and
noth
occur
except
for
polish
general
mobil

renew
act
of
terror

and
final
attack
against
reich
territori


now
in
the
life
of
nation

patienc
must
not
alway
be
interpret
as
weak

for
year
i
patient
look
on
these
continu
provoc

what
keen
suffer
i
underw
in
these
year
onli
few
can
imagin

becaus
there
was
hard
a
month
or
week
in
which
deput
from
these
district
did
not
come
to
me
depict
unbear
condit
and
implor
me
to
interfer


i
have
alway
beg
them
to
tri
again

this
continu
for
year

but
i
have
recent
also
warn
that
this
could
not
go
on
forev

after
again
wait
and
even
receiv
new
propos
i
final
decid

as
i
declar
in
the
reichstag

to
talk
with
poland
in
the
same
languag
as
they
talk
to
us

or
believ
they
could
talk
to
us


the
languag
which
alon
they
seem
to
understand


also

at
this
moment
peac
could
have
been
save

friend
itali
and
i1
duce
came
in
and
made
a
suggest
for
mediat

franc
agre

i
also
express
my
agreement

then
england
reject
also
that
suggest
and
repli
that

instead

germani
might
be
serv
with
a
two
hour
ultimatum
with
imposs
demand

england
er
in
one
thing

there
onc
was
a
govern
in
germani
in
novemb

1918

that
was
kept
by
england

and
they
confound
the
present
german
regim
with
one
they
kept
and
confound
the
present
german
nation
with
the
misl
and
blind
nation
of
that
time


one
doe
not
send
ultimatum
to
the
germani
of
today



may
london
make
note


in
the
last
six
year
i
had
to
stand
intoler
thing
from
state
like
poland


nevertheless
i
sent
no
ultimatum

the
german
reich
is
not
inclin
and
will
not
be
address
in
such
a
tone

i
knew
if
poland
chose
war
she
chose
it
becaus
other
drove
her
into
war

those
other
who
believ
they
might
make
their
biggest
polit
and
financi
kill
in
this
war

but
it
will
not
be
their
biggest
kill

but
their
biggest
disappoint


poland
chose
to
fight
and
she
receiv
a
fight

she
chose
this
fight
light
heart
becaus
certain
statesmen
assur
her
they
had
detail
proof
of
the
worthless
of
germani
and
her
arm
forc

of
the
inferior
of
our
armament

of
the
poor
moral
of
our
troop

of
defeat
within
the
reich

of
a
discrep
between
the
german
peopl
and
it
leadership


the
pole
were
persuad
that
it
would
be
easi
not
onli
to
resist
but
also
to
throw
our
armi
back

poland
construct
her
campaign
on
these
assur
of
the
western
general
staff

sinc
then
eighteen
day
have
pass

and
hard
elsewher
in
histori
can
the
follow
be
said
with
more
truth

the
lord
has
struck
them
down
with
hors

with
man
and
with
wagon


as
i
speak
to
you
our
troop
stand
along
a
great
line
from
brest
litovsk
to
lwow

and
at
this
moment
endless
column
of
the
smash
polish
armi
have
been
march
as
prison
from
that
sector
sinc
yesterday
afternoon

yesterday
morn
there
were
20
000

yesterday
afternoon
50
000

this
morn
70
000

i
do
not
know
how
great
the
number
is
now

but
i
know
one
thing

what
remain
of
the
polish
armi
west
of
that
line
will
capitul
within
a
few
day

they
will
lay
down
their
arm
or
be
crush

at
this
moment

our
thank
heart
fli
to
our
men

the
german
armi
gave
those
genius
statesmen

who
were
so
well
inform
as
to
condit
within
the
reich

a
necessari
lesson





at
this
moment
we
want
to
give
the
polish
soldier
absolut
justic

at
mani
point
the
pole
fought
brave

his
lower
leadership
made
desper
effort

his
middl
grade
leadership
was
too
unintellig

his
highest
leadership
was
bad

judg
by
ani
standard

his
organ
was


polish




i
order
the
german
air
forc
to
conduct
humanitarian
warfar


that
is

to
attack
onli
fight
troop

the
polish
govern
and
armi
leadership
order
the
civilian
popul
to
carri
on
the
war
as
franc
tireur
from
ambush

it
is
veri
difficult
under
these
circumst
to
hold
one
s
self
back

i
want
to
stress
that
the
democrat
state
should
not
imagin
it
must
be
that
way

if
they
want
it
otherwis

they
can
have
it
otherwis

my
patienc
can
have
limit
here
also








so

we
have
beaten
poland
within
eighteen
day
and
thus
creat
a
situat
which
perhap
make
it
possibl
one
day
to
speak
to
repres
of
the
polish
peopl
calm
and
reason


meantim

russia
felt
move

on
it
part

to
march
in
for
the
protect
of
the
interest
of
the
white
russian
and
ukrainian
peopl
in
poland

we
realiz
now
that
in
england
and
franc
this
german
and
russian
co
oper
is
consid
a
terribl
crime

an
englishman
even
wrote
that
it
is
perfidi


well

the
english
ought
to
know

i
believ
england
think
this
co
oper
perfidi
becaus
the
co
oper
of
democrat
england
with
bolshevist
russia
fail

while
nation
socialist
germani
s
attempt
with
soviet
russia
succeed


i
want
to
give
here
an
explan

russia
remain
what
she
is

germani
also
remain
what
she
is

about
onli
one
thing
are
both
regim
clear

neither
the
german
nor
the
russian
regim
want
to
sacrific
a
singl
man
for
the
interest
of
the
western
democraci

a
lesson
of
four
year
was
suffici
for
both
peopl

we
know
onli
too
well
that
altern

now
one
then
the
other

would
be
grant
the
honor
to
fill
the
breach
for
the
ideal
of
the
western
democraci


we
therefor
thank
both
peopl
and
both
state
for
this
task

we
intend
henceforth
to
look
after
our
interest
ourselv

and
we
have
found
that
we
best
have
been
abl
to
look
after
them
when
two
of
the
largest
peopl
and
state
reconcil
each
other

and
this
is
made
simpler
by
the
fact
that
the
british
assert
as
to
the
unlimit
charact
of
german
foreign
polici
is
a
lie

i
am
happi
now
to
be
abl
to
refut
this
lie
for
british
statesmen

british
statesmen

who
continu
maintain
that
germani
intend
to
domin
europ
to
the
ural
now
will
be
pleas
to
learn
the
limit
of
german
polit
intent

i
believ
this
will
depriv
them
of
a
reason
for
war
becaus
they
profess
to
have
to
fight
against
the
present
regim
becaus
it
today
pursu
unlimit
polit
goal


now

gentlemen
of
the
great
british
empire

the
aim
of
germani
are
close
limit

we
discuss
the
matter
with
russia


they

after
all

are
the
most
immedi
interest
neighbor


and
if
you
are
of
the
opinion
that
we
might
come
to
a
conflict
on
the
subject


we
will
not


britain
ought
to
welcom
the
fact
that
germani
and
soviet
russia
have
come
to
an
understand

for
this
understand
mean
the
elimin
of
that
nightmar
which
kept
british
statesmen
from
sleep
becaus
they
were
so
concern
over
the
ambit
of
the
present

german

regim
to
conquer
the
world

it
will
calm
you
to
learn
that
germani
doe
not

and
did
not

want
to
conquer
the
ukrain

we
have
veri
limit
interest

but
we
are
determin
to
maintain
those
interest
despit
all
danger

despit
anyon


and
that
we
did
not
permit
ourselv
to
be
trifl
with
in
those
past
eighteen
day
may
have
been
prove
suffici

how
a
definit
settlement
of
state
condit
in
this
conflict
will
look
depend
first
and
foremost
upon
the
two
countri
which
there
have
their
most
import
vital
interest


germani
has
there
limit
but
unalter
claim

and
she
will
realiz
those
claim
one
way
or
anoth

germani
and
russia
will
put
in
place
the
hotb
of
conflict
in
the
european
situat
which
later
will
be
valu
onli
as
a
relax
of

if
the

now
declar
that

if
especi
england
declar
that
she
is

this
in

then

and
sinc
england
today

i
would
like
to
answer
thus


poland
will
never

again
in
the
form
of
the

that
is
guarante
not

by

german
fellow

he
who
want
to
have
the
deepest
impress
of

decay
and
resurrect
of

most
vivid
must
go
and
see
the
develop
of
a
citi
like
wilhelmshaven

which
today
reverber
with
life
and
activ
and
which
still
a
short
time
ago
was
a
dead
spot
near
without
mean
of

and
without
prospect
of
a

it
pay
to
revisu
this
past


when
this
citi
experienc
it
first
upward
move
it

the
rise
of
the
german

after
it
unif

this
germani
was
in
a
state
of
peac


dure
the
same
time
as
the
so
call
peac
love
and
puritan
nation
led
a
great
number
of

germani
then
knew
onli
one
aim

to
maintain
peac

to
work
in
peac

to
rais
the
prosper
of
it
inhabit

and
therebi
to
contribut
to
human
cultur
and

this
germani
of
peac
time
has
attempt

with
unend
dilig

with
genial

and
with
steadi

to
form
it
life
within
and
to
safeguard
outward


through
particip
in
peac
competit
with
the
nation


it
due
place
in
the
sun


even
though
this
germani
through
the
decad
was
the
safest
guarantor
of
peac

and
even
though
she
occupi
herself
with
peac
thing

she
was
unabl
to
prevent
other
nation

and
especi
their
statesmen

from
follow
this
rise
with
envi
and
hatr
and
final
to
answer
with
a
war


today
we
know
from
the
document
of
histori
how
the
encircl
polici
of
those
time
was
carri
on
in
a
plan
way
by
england


we
know
from
numer
find
and
public
that
in
that
countri
the
concept
was
that
it
would
be
necessari
to
bring
down
germani
militarili
becaus
it
destruct
would
insur
everi
british
citizen
a
greater
abund
of
life
s
possess


certain
at
that
time
germani
made
mistak

its
most
serious
mistak
was
to
see
this
encircl
and
not
to
stave
it
off
in
time


the
onli
fault
we
can
blame
the
regim
of
that
time
for
is
that
the
reich
had
full
knowledg
of
this
devilish
plan
of
a
raid
and
yet
it
did
not
have
the
power
of
decis
to
ward
it
off
in
time
and
could
onli
let
this
encircl
ripen
until
the
begin
of
the
catastroph


the
result
was
the
world
war

in
this
war
the
german
peopl

although
it
had
by
no
mean
the
best
armament

fought
heroic

no
peopl
can
claim
the
glori
for
itself
to
have
forc
us
down


much
less
so
that
nation
whose
statesmen
today
speak
the
greatest
word


germani
at
that
time
remain
undef
and
unconqu
on
land

at
sea

and
in
the
air


howev

it
was
germani


but
there
was
the
power
of
the
lie
and
the
poison
of
propaganda
which
did
not
balk
at
misinterpret
and
untruth


this
germani
face

for

as
this
dictat
of

it
was
actual
damn
to
go
to
the
ground

if

howev

other
statesmen
now
declar
that
right
must
rule
on
this
earth

then
they
should
be
told
that
their
crime
is
no
right

that
their
dictat
is
neither
right
nor
law
but
abov
this
dictat
stand
the
etern
right
of

to

the
german
peopl
were
not
creat
by
provid
in
order
to
follow
obedi
a
law
which
suit
the
english
or
the
french

but
rather
in
order
to
champion
their
right
to
live

that
is
whi
we
are
here

i
was
determin
to
take
up
this
battl
of
advoc
the
german
right
to
live


i
took
it
up
first
within
the
nation


in
place
of
a
great
number
of
parti

social
rank

and
societi

a
singl
communiti
now
has
taken
it
place


the
german
nation
communiti

to
bring
it
to
realiz
and
to
deepen
it
more
and
more
is
our
task


i
had
to
hurt
mani
in
this

howev

i
believ
that
the
good

in
which
the
entir

is
particip

must
rich
compens
everi
singl
one
for
what
he
had
to
give
up
dear
on
his
own
part


you
all
have
sacrif
your
parti

societi

and
associ

but
you
have
obtain
in
return
a
great
strong
reich

and
the
reich
today

thank
god

is
strong
enough
to
take
your
right
under
it
protect


we
no
longer
are
depend
on
the
good
grace
or
disgrac
of
other
state
or
their
statesmen


when

more
than
six
year
ago

i
obtain
power

i
took
over
a
wretch
inherit

the
reich
seem
to
possess
no
more
possibl
of
exist
for
it
citizen


i
undertook
the
work
at
that
time
with
the
one
singl
capit
which
i
possess

it
was
the
capit
of
your
strength
to
work


your
strength
to
work

my
fellow
citizen

i
now
have
begun
to
put
to
use

i
had
no
foreign
exchang

i
had
no
gold
reserv

i
had
onli
one
thing


my
faith
and
your
work


thus
we
began
the
gigant
work
of
rebuild
base
upon
the
confid
of
the
nation

instil
with
the
belief
and
the
confid
in
it
etern
valu


now
we
have
found
a
new
econom
system

a
system
which
is
this

capit
is
the
power
of
labor
and
the
coverag
of
money
lie
in
our
product


we
have
found
a
system
base
on
the
most
sincer
foundat
there
is

name

form
your
life
yourself

work
for
your
exist

help
yourself
and
god
will
help
you


within
a
few
year
we
have
wrench
germani
from
despair

but
the
world
did
not
help
us

if
today
an
english
statesman
say
one
can
and
must
solv
all
problem
through
frank
deliber

i
should
like
to
tell
this
statesman
just
this

an
opportun
has
been
open
for
fifteen
year
befor
our
time


if
the
world
say
today
that
the
nation
must
be
divid
into
virtuous
nation
and
into
such
as
are
not
virtuous


and
that
the
english
and
french
belong
to
the
first
class

and
the
german
and
italian
belong
to
those
not
virtuous


we
can
onli
answer

the
judgment
whether
a
peopl
is
virtuous
or
not
virtuous
can
hard
be
pass
by
a
human
be

that
should
be
left
to
god


perhap
the
same
british
statesman
will
retort


god
has
pass
the
verdict
alreadi

becaus
he
present
the
virtuous
nation
with
one
quarter
of
the
world
and
he
took
everyth
away
from
the
nonvirtu



the
question
may
be
permit


by
what
mean
have
the
virtuous
nation
obtain
for
themselv
this
quarter
of
the
world



and
one
must
answer


they
did
not
appli
virtuous
method



for
300
year
this
england
act
without
virtu
in
order
now
in
matur
to
speak
of
virtu

thus
it
could
appear
that
dure
this
british
period
without
virtu
46
000
000
englishmen
have
subdu
near
one
quarter
of
the
world
while
80
000
000
german

becaus
of
their
virtu

must
live
at
a
rate
of
140
to
one
squar
kilomet


indeed

twenti
year
ago

the
question
of
virtu
still
was
not
entir
clear
for
the
british
statesmen
insofar
as
it
concern
concept
of
properti

one
still
held
it
compat
with
virtu
simpli
to
take
away
the
coloni
of
anoth
peopl
that
had
acquir
them
through
treati
or
through
purchas
becaus
one
possess
the
power


this
veri
power
which
now

to
be
sure

should
be
deem
as
someth
abomin
and
detest


i
have
onli
one
thing
to
ask
the
gentlemen
here

whether
they
believ
what
they
say
or
do
not
believ
it

we
do
not
know


we
assum

howev

that
they
do
not
believ
what
they
say

for
if
we
should
assum
that
they
themselv
realli
believ
it
then
we
would
lose
everi
respect
for
them


for
fifteen
year
germani
patient
bore
it
lot
and
fate

i
also
sought
in
the
begin
to
solv
everi
problem
through
talk

i
made
an
offer
in
the
case
of
each
problem
and
each
time
it
was
turn
down


there
can
be
no
doubt
that
everi
peopl
possess
sacr
interest

simpli
becaus
they
are
ident
with
their
live
and
their
right
to
live


when

today

a
british
statesman
demand
that
everi
problem
which
lie
in
the
midst
of
germani
s
life
interest
first
should
be
discuss
with
england


then
i

too

could
demand
just
as
well
that
everi
british
problem
first
is
to
be
discuss
with
us


certain

these
englishmen
may
give
me
the
answer


the
german
have
no
busi
in
palestin


i
answer
that
we
do
not
want
anyth
in
palestin


just
as
we
german
have
littl
to
do
in
palestin

just
as
littl
busi
has
england
mix
in
our
german
section
of
exist

and
if
they
now
declar
that
it
involv
general
question
of
law
and
justic
i
could
approv
of
this
opinion
onli
if
it
was
consid
as
bind
to
both
of
us


they
say
we
have
no
right
to
do
this
or
that

i
should
like
to
rais
the
counter
question

what
right

for
exampl

has
england
to
shoot
down
arab
in
palestin
just
becaus
they
defend
their
homeland

who
give
them
this
right


anyway

we
have
not
slaughter
thousand
in
central
europ
but
instead
we
have
regul
our
problem
with
law
and
order


howev

i
should
like
to
say
one
thing
here

the
german
peopl
of
today

the
german
reich
of
today
is
not
will
to
surrend
life
interest

it
also
is
not
will
to
face
rise
danger
without
do
someth
about
them


when
the
alli

without
regard
or
purpos

right

tradit

or
even
reason

chang
the
map
of
europ

we
had
not
the
power
to
prevent
it

if

howev

they
expect
the
germani
of
today
to
sit
patient
by
until
the
veri
last
day
when
this
same
result
would
again
be
repeat


while
they
creat
satellit
state
and
set
them
against
germani


then
they
are
mistak
the
germani
of
today
for
the
germani
of
befor
the
war


he
who
declar
himself
readi
to
pull
the
chestnut
out
of
the
fire
for
these
power
must
realiz
he
burn
his
finger


realli

we
feel
no
hatr
against
the
czech
peopl

we
have
live
togeth
for
year

the
english
statesmen
do
not
know
this

they
have
no
idea
that
hradcani
castl
was
not
built
by
an
englishman
but
by
a
german
and
that
the
st

vitus
cathedr
likewis
was
not
erect
by
englishmen
but
that
german
hand
did
it


even
the
french
were
not
activ
there

they
do
not
know
that
alreadi
at
a
time
when
england
still
was
veri
small
a
german
kaiser
was
paid
homag
on
this
hill

hradcani
castl

that
one
thousand
year
befor
me
the
first
german
king
stood
there
and
accept
the
homag
of
this
peopl


englishmen
do
not
know
that

they
could
not
know
that
and
they
do
not
have
to
know
it

it
is
suffici
that
we
know
it
and
that
it
is
true
that
this
territori
lay
in
the
live
space
of
the
german
peopl
for
over
a
thousand
year


despit
this

howev

we
would
have
had
noth
against
an
independ
czech
state
if

first

it
had
not
suppress
german

and

second

if
it
had
not
been
intend
as
the
instrument
of
a
futur
attack
on
germani

when

howev

a
former
french
air
minist
write
in
a
newspap
that
on
the
basi
of
their
promin
posit
it
is
the
task
of
these
czech
to
strike
at
the
heart
of
german
industri
with
air
attack
dure
war

then
one
understand
that
this
is
not
without
interest
to
us
and
that
we
draw
certain
conclus
from
it


it
would
have
been
up
to
england
and
franc
to
defend
this
airbas

upon
us
fell
the
task
of
prevent
such
an
attack
at
all
event

i
sought
to
accomplish
this
by
a
natur
and
simpl
way


when
i
first
saw
that
everi
effort
of
that
kind
was
destin
to
be
wreck
and
that
element
hostil
to
germani
again
would
win
the
upper
hand

and
as
i
further
saw
that
this
state
had
long
sinc
lost
it
inner
vital


inde

that
it
alreadi
was
broken
to
piec


i
again
carri
through
the
old
german
reich

and
i
join
togeth
again
what
had
to
be
unit
becaus
of
histori
and
geograph
posit

and
accord
to
all
rule
of
reason


not
to
oppress
the
czech
peopl

it
will
enjoy
more
freedom
than
the
suppress
peopl
of
the
virtuous
nation


i
have

so
i
believ

therebi
render
peac
a
great
servic

becaus
i
have
render
innocu
in
time
an
instrument
which
was
destin
to
becom
effect
in
war
against
germani

if
they
now
say
that
this
is
the
signal
that
germani
now
want
to
attack
the
entir
world

i
do
not
believ
that
this
is
meant
serious

such
could
onli
be
the
express
of
a
bad
conscienc


perhap
it
is
rage
over
the
failur
of
a
far
flung
plan

perhap
it
is
an
attempt
to
creat
tactic
precondit
for
a
new
polici
of
encircl


be
that
as
it
may

it
is
my
convict
that
therebi
i
have
render
peac
a
great
servic
and
out
of
this
convict
i
decid
three
week
ago
to
name
the
come
parti
ralli
the

parti
convent
of
peac



for
germani
has
no
intent
of
attack
other
peopl

what
we

howev

do
not
want
to
renounc
is
the
build
up
of
our
econom
relat

we
have
a
right
thereto
and
i
do
not
accept
ani
condit
from
a
european
or
a
non
european
statesman


the
german
reich
is
not
onli
a
great
produc
but
also
a
gigant
consum

just
as
we
as
a
produc
will
be
an
irreplac
trade
partner

so
as
a
consum
we
are
capabl
of
honor
and
fair
pay
for
what
we
consum


we
are
not
think
about
make
war
on
other
peopl

howev

our
precondit
is
that
they
leav
us
in
peac


in
ani
case
the
german
reich
is
not
readi
everlast
to
accept
intimid
or
even
a
polici
of
encircl


i
onc
made
an
agreement
with
england


name

the
naval
treati

it
is
base
on
the
earnest
desir
which
we
all
possess
never
to
have
to
go
to
war
against
england

but
this
wish
can
onli
be
a
mutual
one


if
this
wish
no
longer
exist
in
england

then
the
practic
precondit
for
this
agreement
therewith
are
remov
and
germani
also
would
accept
this
veri
calm

we
are
self
assur
becaus
we
are
strong

and
we
are
strong
becaus
we
are
unit
and
becaus
in
addit
we
are
look
forward

and
in
this
citi

my
fellow
citizen

i
can
address
the
one
exhort
to
you

look
into
the
world
and
to
all
it
happen
with
open
eye

do
not
deceiv
yourselv
about
the
most
import
precondit
in
life


name

the
necess
to
be
strong


we
have
experienc
this
for
fifteen
year

therefor
i
have
made
germani
strong
again
and
erect
an
arm
forc

an
armi
on
land

at
sea

and
in
the
air


when
they
say
in
other
countri
that
they
will
arm
and
will
keep
arm
still
more

i
can
tell
those
statesmen
onli
this

they
will
not
be
abl
to
tire
me
out

i
am
determin
to
proceed
on
this
road
and
i
have
a
convict
that
we
shall
proceed
faster
than
the
other

no
power
on
earth
will
ever
again
be
abl
to
entic
the
weapon
from
us
through
ani
phrase


should

howev

somebodi
be
crave
for
measur
their
strength
with
our

then
the
german
peopl
also
are
readi
at
ani
time
and
i
am
readi
and
determin


just
as
we
think

our
friend
also
think

especi
the
state
with
which
we
are
bound
most
close
and
with
which
we
are
march
now
and
will
march
under
all
circumst
forev


if
hostil
journalist
do
not
know
of
anyth
els
to
write

then
they
write
about
rent
or
break
in
the
axis

they
ought
to
hold
their
peac

this
axis
is
the
most
natur
polit
instrument
exist
in
this
world


it
is
a
polit
combin
which
owe
it
origin
not
onli
to
reason
polit
deliber
and
the
desir
for
justic
but
also
to
the
power
of
an
ideal


this
construct
will
be
more
durabl
than
the
momentari
tie
of
nonhomogen
bodi
on
the
other
side

for
if
some
one
tell
me
today
that
there
are
no
philosoph
or
ideolog
differ
of
ani
kind
between
england
and
soviet
russia

then
i
can
onli
say



i
congratul
you

gentlemen



i
believ
that
the
time
is
not
far
distant
in
which
the
philosoph
communiti
between
fascist
itali
and
nation
socialist
germani
will
prove
essenti
differ
than
the
one
between
democrat
great
britain
and
the
bolshevist
russia
of
stalin


howev

if
there
realli
should
be
no
ideolog
differ

then
i
can
onli
say

how
correct

inde

is
my
posit
toward
marxism
and
communism
and
democraci

whi
two
phenomena
if
they
possess
the
same
content


in
these
day
we
experi
a
veri
great
triumph
and
a
deep
inner
satisfact

a
countri
which
also
was
devast
by
bolshev

where
hundr
of
thousand
of
human
be

women

men

children

and
patriarch
have
been
slaughter

has
liber
itself

liber
despit
all
the
ideolog
friend
of
bolshev
who
sit
in
great
britain

franc
and
in
other
countri


we
can
understand
this
spain
onli
too
well
in
it
struggl
and
we
greet
and
congratul
it
for
it
success

we
german
of
today
can
express
this
with
special
pride

sinc
mani
german
young
men
have
done
their
duti
there

they
have
help
as
volunt
to
break
a
tyrann
regim
and
to
return
to
a
nation
the
right
of
self
determin


we
are
pleas
to
note
how
fast

how
extrem
fast

the
philosoph
chang
came
over
the
deliver
of
war
materi
on
the
red
side

we
note
how
much
they
now

all
of
a
sudden

understand
this
nation
spain
and
how
readi
they
are
to
conduct
with
this
nation
spain

if
not
philosoph

then
at
least
econom
busi


this
also
is
a
sign
show
the
trend
of
develop


my
fellow
citizen

i
believ
that
all
state
will
be
face
the
same
problem
which
we
have
face


state
after
state
will
either
fall
under
the
jewish
bolshevist
pest
or
it
will
defend
itself


we
have
done
it
and
have
now
erect
a
nation
german
peopl
s
state

this
peopl
s
state
want
to
live
in
peac
and
friendship
with
ani
other
state
but
it
will
never
again
let
itself
be
forc
down
by
anoth
state


i
do
not
know
whether
the
world
will
becom
fascist

but
i
am
deepli
convinc
that
this
world
in
the
end
will
defend
itself
against
the
most
sever
bolshevist
threat
that
exist


therefor
i
believ
that
a
final
understand
between
nation
will
come
sooner
or
later

onli
when
this
jewish
wedg
among
peopl
is
remov
can
the
establish
of
co
oper
among
nation


built
on
last
understand


be
consid


today
we
must
reli
upon
our
own
strength

and
we
can
be
satisfi
with
the
result
of
this
trust
in
ourselv


inward
and
outward


when
i
came
to
power

my
fellow
citizen

germani
was
divid
and
impot
intern

and
outward
the
sport
of
foreign
design

today
we
are
in
order
domest

our
busi
is
flourish


abroad
perhap
we
are
not
love

but
respect

yet
we
receiv
attent

that
is
the
decis
factor

above
all
we
have
given
the
greatest
possibl
good
fortun
to
million
of
our
fellow
citizen


the
return
into
our
greater
german
reich


second

we
have
given
central
europ
a
great
piec
of
good
fortun

name

peac


peac
that
will
be
protect
by
german
might

and
this
might
can
no
longer
be
broken
by
ani
world
power

that
is
our
pledg


so
we
will
show
that
over
two
million
citizen
did
not
fall
in
the
great
war
in
vain

from
their
sacrific
came
greater
germani

from
their
sacrific
was
this
strong
young
german
peopl
that
the
reich
call
into
be
and
that
has
now
made
itself
felt

in
the
face
of
this
sacrific
we
shall
not
shi
away
from
ani
sacrific
if
it
is
ever
necessari


let
the
world
understand
that


it
can
make
pact
and
draw
up
declar
as
much
as
it
wish

i
have
no
faith
in
paper

but
i
do
have
faith
in
you

my
fellow
citizen


the
greatest
breach
of
faith
of
all
time
was
commit
against
us
german

let
us
take
care
that
our
peopl
intern
are
never
again
in
a
posit
to
be
broken

then
no
one
in
the
world
will
threaten
us

then
peac
will
either
be
maintain
for
our
peopl
or

if
necessari

peac
will
be
enforc


then
our
peopl
will
bloom
and
flourish

our
peopl
will
be
abl
to
put
their
genial

their
abil

their
dilig
and
steadfast
into
the
work
of
peac
and
human
cultur

this
is
our
desir

we
hope
for
it
and
we
believ
in
it


twenti
year
ago
that
parti
was
found


at
that
time
a
tini
organ

consid
the
road
from
that
time
until
today

consid
the
wonder
which
have
occur
about
us


believ

therefor

becaus
of
this
wonder
road

also
in
the
cours
of
the
german
peopl
in
it
come
great
futur


germani


sieg
heil

sieg
heil

sieg
heil

what
seem
to
us
almost
a
miracl
as
we
look
back
upon
it
is
noth
els
than
the
reward
for
infinit
and
unweari
labor




and
now
for
that
labor
we
have
receiv
from
provid
our
reward

just
as
the
germani
of
1918
receiv
it
reward

at
that
time
germani
share
in
those
bless
which
we
think
of
under
the
collect
idea
democraci

but
germani
has
learn
that
democraci
in
practic
is
a
differ
thing
from
democraci
in
theori


if
today
at
time
in
foreign
countri
parliamentarian
or
politician
ventur
to
maintain
that
germani
has
not
kept
her
treati

then
we
can
give
as
our
answer
to
these
men

the
greatest
breach
of
a
treati
that
ever
was
practic
on
the
german
peopl

everi
promis
which
had
been
made
to
germani
in
the
fourteen
point


those
promis
on
the
faith
of
which
germani
had
laid
down
her
arm


was
afterward
broken

in
1932
germani
was
face
with
final
collaps

the
german
reich
and
peopl
both
seem
lost

and
then
came
the
german
resurrect

it
began
with
a
chang
of
faith

while
all
the
german
parti
befor
us
believ
in
forc
and
ideal
which
lay
outsid
of
the
german
reich
and
outsid
of
our
peopl

we
nation
socialist
have
resolut
champion
belief
in
our
own
peopl

start
from
that
watchword
of
etern
valid

god
help
onli
those
who
are
prepar
and
determin
to
help
themselv

in
the
place
of
all
those
intern
factor


democraci

the
conscienc
of
peopl

the
conscienc
of
the
world

the
leagu
of
nation

and
the
like


we
have
set
a
singl
factor


our
own
peopl








we
were
all
convinc
that
a
true
communiti
of
the
peopl
is
not
produc
overnight


it
is
not
attain
through
theori
or
program


but
that
through
mani
decad

yes

and
perhap
alway
and
for
all
time
the
individu
must
be
train
for
this
communiti

this
work
of
educ
we
have
carri
through
ever
sinc
the
parti
was
found
and
especi
sinc
we
came
into
power

but
noth
is
perfect
in
this
world
and
no
success
can
be
felt
to
be
final
satisfi

and
so

even
today

we
have
no
wish
to
maintain
that
our
achiev
is
alreadi
the
realiz
of
our
ideal

we
have
an
ideal
which
float
befor
our
mind
and
in
accord
with
that
ideal
we
educ
german

generat
after
generat

so
nation
social
will
continu
be
transform
from
a
profess
of
polit
faith
to
a
real
educ
of
the
peopl





the
umbrella
carri
type
of
our
former
bourgeoi
world
of
parti
are
extinguish
and
they
will
never
return




from
the
veri
first
day
i
have
proclaim
as
a
fundament
principl


the
german
is
either
the
first
soldier
in
the
world
or
he
is
no
soldier
at
all


no
soldier
at
all
we
cannot
be

and
we
do
not
wish
to
be

therefor
we
shall
be
onli
the
first

as
one
who
is
a
lover
of
peac
i
have
endeavor
to
creat
for
the
german
peopl
such
an
armi
and
such
munit
as
are
calcul
to
convinc
other

too

to
seek
peac


there
are

it
is
true

peopl
who
abus
the
hedgehog
becaus
it
has
spine

but
they
have
onli
got
to
leav
the
anim
in
peac

no
hedgehog
has
ever
attack
anyon
unless
he
was
first
threaten

that
should
be
our
posit

too

folk
must
not
come
too
near
us

we
want
noth
els
than
to
be
left
in
peac

we
want
the
possibl
of
go
on
with
our
work

we
claim
for
our
peopl
the
right
to
live

the
same
right
which
other
claim
for
themselv

and
that
the
democrat
state
abov
all
other
should
grasp
and
understand

for
they
never
stop
talk
about
equal
of
right

if
they
keep
talk
about
the
right
of
small
peopl

how
can
they
be
outrag
if
in
it
turn
a
great
peopl
claim
the
same
right

our
nation
socialist
armi
serv
to
secur
and
guarante
this
claim
of
right


it
is
with
this
in
view
that
in
foreign
polici
also
i
have
initi
a
chang
in
our
attitud
and
have
drawn
closer
to
those
who
like
us
were
compel
to
stand
up
for
their
right


and
when
today
i
examin
the
result
of
this
action
of
our

then
i
am
abl
to
say

judg
all
of
you
for
yourselv

have
we
not
gain
enorm
through
act
on
these
principl


but
precis
for
this
reason
we
do
not
wish
that
we
should
ever
forget
what
has
made
these
success
of
our
possibl

when
certain
foreign
newspap
write


but
all
that
you
could
have
gain
by
the
way
of
negoti


we
know
veri
well
that
germani
befor
our
day
did
noth
but
negoti
continu

for
fifteen
year
they
onli
negoti
and
they
lost
everyth
for
their
pain

i

too

am
readi
to
negoti
but
i
leav
no
one
in
ani
doubt
that
neither
by
way
of
negoti
nor
by
ani
other
way
will
i
allow
the
right
of
germani
to
be
cut
down

never
forget

german
peopl

to
what
it
is
you
owe
your
success


to
what
movement

to
what
idea

and
to
what
principl

and
in
the
second
place

alway
be
cautious

be
ever
on
your
guard


it
is
veri
fine
to
talk
of
intern
peac
and
intern
disarma

but
i
am
mistrust
of
a
disarma
in
weapon
of
war
so
long
as
there
has
been
no
disarma
of
the
spirit


there
has
been
form
in
the
world
the
curious
custom
of
divid
peopl
into
so
call

authoritarian

state

that
is
disciplin
state

and
democrat
state

in
the
authoritarian

that
is

the
disciplin
state

it
goe
without
say
that
one
doe
not
abus
foreign
peopl

doe
not
lie
about
them

doe
not
incit
to
war

but
the
democrat
state
are
precis

democrat


that
is

that
all
this
can
happen
there
in
the
authoritarian
state
a
war


agit
is
of
cours
imposs

for
their
govern
are
under
an
oblig
to
see
to
it
that
there
is
no
such
thing

in
the
democraci

on
the
other
hand

the
govern
have
onli
one
duti

to
maintain
democraci

and
that
mean
the
liberti

if
necessari

to
incit
to
war





mr

churchil
had
state
his
view
public

name
that
the
present
regim
in
germani
must
be
overthrown
with
the
aid
of
forc
within
germani
which
would
glad
co
oper

if
mr

churchil
would
but
spend
less
of
his
time
in
emigr
circl

that
is
with
traitor
to
their
countri
maintain
and
paid
abroad

and
more
of
his
time
with
german

then
he
would
realiz
the
utter
mad
and
stupid
of
his
idl
chatter

i
can
onli
assur
this
gentleman

who
would
appear
to
be
live
in
the
moon

of
one
thing

there
is
no
such
forc
in
germani
which
could
turn
against
the
present
regim


i
will
not
refus
to
grant
to
this
gentleman
that

natur
we
have
no
right
to
demand
that
the
other
peopl
should
alter
their
constitut

but

as
leader
of
the
german

i
have
the
duti
to
consid
this
constitut
of
their
and
the
possibl
which
result
from
it

when
a
few
day
ago
in
the
hous
of
common
the
deputi
leader
of
the
opposit
declar
that
he
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
would
welcom
the
destruct
of
germani
and
itali

then

of
cours

i
cannot
prevent
it
if
perhap
this
man
on
the
basi
of
the
democrat
rule
of
the
game
should
in
fact
with
his
parti
in
one
or
two
year
becom
the
govern

but
of
one
thing
i
can
assur
him

i
can
prevent
him
from
destroy
germani

and
just
as
i
am
convinc
that
the
german
peopl
will
take
care
that
the
plan
of
these
gentlemen
so
far
as
germani
is
concern
will
never
succeed

so
in
precis
the
same
way
fascist
itali
will

i
know

take
care
for
itself


i
believ
that
for
us
all
these
intern
hope
can
onli
teach
us
to
stand
firm
togeth
and
to
cling
to
our
friend

the
more
that
we
in
germani
form
a
singl
communiti

the
less
favor
will
be
the
prospect
of
these
incit
to
war

and
the
closer
we
unit
ourselv
in
particular
with
the
state
which
is
in
a
posit
similar
to
our

with
itali

the
less
desir
they
will
have
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
us








germani
has
becom
greater
by
the
most
natur
way

by
a
way
which
could
not
be
more
moral
unassail




when
the
rest
of
the
world
speak
of
disarma

then
we
too
are
readi
for
disarma

but
under
one
condit

the
war
agit
must
first
be
disarm


so
long
as
the
other
onli
talk
of
disarma

while
they
infam
continu
to
incit
to
war

we
must
presum
that
they
do
but
wish
to
steal
from
us
our
arm

in
order
onc
more
to
prepar
for
us
the
fate
of
1918
19

and
in
that
case

my
onli
answer
to
mr

churchil
and
his
like
must
be

that
happen
onc
onli
and
it
will
not
be
repeat
german
folk


if
in
the
midst
of
these
great
day
and
their
occurr
i
have
come
into
your
district

then
it
was
done
in
the
convict
that
nobodi
can
evinc
greater
appreci
of
these
last
week
and
day
than
yourself


you
may

men
and
women
of
saarland

you
have
experienc
for
yourselv
what
it
mean
to
be
separ
from
the
reich
and
you
yourselv
have
gone
through
the
joy
of
be
reunit

you

too

suffer
all
this
woe
for
two
decad

and
you

too

were
suprem
happi
when
the
hour
of
reunion
struck
and
you
could
return
to
the
common
reich

exact
that
same
thing
was
experienc
and
particip
in
by
million
of
german

the
same
joy
seiz
them
that
onc
stir
you

at
the
begin
of
this
year

the
twentieth
after
our
collaps

i
made
a
decis
to
lead
back
into
the
reich
10
000
000
german
who
still
stood
outsid


it
was
perfect
clear
to
me
that
this
return
could
be
compel
onli
by
our
own
strength

the
rest
of
the
world

for
the
largest
part

had
no
understand

it
neither
saw
nor
want
to
see
that
here

10
000
000
human

in
violat
of
the
so
call
right
of
self
determin
of
peopl

had
been
separ
from
the
german
peopl
and
the
reich
and
had
been
maltreat

but
it
has
not
understood
that
these
human
be
had
but
one
great
yearn

name

to
return
to
the
reich

these
intern
world
citizen
have
compass
inde

for
everi
scoundrel
who
is
call
to
account
in
germani

but
they
are
deaf
to
the
suffer
of
million

that
world
is
still
fill
with
the
spirit
of
versaill

it
did
not
free
itself
from
it

no

germani
has
liber
herself
from
it


even
today
it
still
is
a
mixtur
of
terribl
inconsider
and
appal
ignor
for
these
countri
to
overlook
justic
and
give
last
effect
to
injustic

and
so
these
world
democraci
remain
deaf
for
twenti
year
to
all
the
suffer
and
demand
of
10
000
000
german

accord

a
hard
decis
had
to
be
made

among
us

too

there
were
weak
charact
who
did
not
understand
this

it
is
self
evid

howev

that
statesmen
conscious
of
their
respons
made
it
a
point
of
honor
to
take
respons


the
follow
were
the
precondit
for
bring
about
and
carri
through
solut


first

intern
uniti
of
the
nation

i
am
convinc
i
am
leader
of
a
man
peopl

i
know
what
probabl
mani
in
the
rest
of
the
world
and
even
isol
one
in
germani
do
not
seem
as
yet
to
know


name

that
the
peopl
of
the
year
1938
are
not
the
peopl
of
1918

onli
those
who
were
blind
concern
nation
social
could
overlook
the
tremend
work
of
educ
that
the
good
philosophi
of
life
has
accomplish

there
has
been
creat
today
a
communiti
of
spirit
throughout
our
peopl
of
power
and
strength
such
as
germani
never
befor
has
known

this
was
the
first
precondit
for
the
undertak

and
for
the
success
of
this
task


second
was
nation
rearmament

which
i
sponsor
fanat
for
six
year

i
am
of
the
opinion
that
it
is
cheaper
to
prepar
one
s
self
befor
event
than
to
lie
prostrat
unprepar
for
event
and
then
pay
the
foreign
countri


the
third
thing
was
render
secur
the
reich

and
here
you
yourselv
are
wit
to
the
tremend
work
that
is
be
accomplish
in
your
veri
neighborhood

i
need
tell
you
no
detail
about
it

i
will
give
express

howev

to
but
one
convict

no
power
in
the
world
will
be
able
to
push
through
this
wall


fourth

we
have
gain
foreign
friend

that
axi
that
peopl
in
other
countri
so
often
think
they
can
ridicul
has

dure
the
last
two
and
a
half
year

not
onli
prove
durabl
but
has
prove
that
even
in
the
worst
hour
it
con

tinu
to
function

nevertheless

we
are
especi
happi
that
this
task
of
the
year
1938
of
again
join
10
000
000
german
and
about
110
000
squar
kilomet

42
470
squar
mile

to
the
reich
could
be
accomplish
in
peac


we
are
all
so
happi
no
blood
was
shed
over
this
despit
the
hope
of
so
mani
intern
agit
and
profit

if
i
mention
the
help
of
the
rest
of
the
world
in
bring
about
this
peac
solut

i
must
again
and
again
place
at
the
head
of
it
our
onli
real
friend
whom
we
possess
today


benito
mussolini


i
know

and
i
know
that
you
know
what
we
owe
this
man

i
should
like
also
to
mention
two
other
statesmen
who
tri
hard
to
find
a
way
to
peac
and
who

togeth
with
the
great
italian
and
us
have
conclud
an
agreement
that
secur
justic
for
10
000
000
german
and
peac
for
the
world

i
am
happi
these
million
of
german
are
free

that
they
belong
to
us
and
that
peac
has
been
secur


nevertheless

the
experi

especi
of
the
last
eight
month

must
strengthen
our
resolv
to
be
care
and
never
to
leav
anyth
undon
that
must
be
done
for
the
protect
of
the
reich

opposit
us
are
statesmen
who


that

we
must
believ
of
them


also
want
peac

however

thei
govern
in
countries
whose
internal
construction
makes
it
possible
for
them
at
ani
time
to
be
supplanted
by
others
who
do
not
aim
at
peace

these
others
are
there

in
england

it
mereli
is
necessari
that
instead
of
chamberlain

a
duff
cooper
or
an
eden
or
a
churchill
come
into
power

we
know
that
the
aim
of
these
men
would
be
to
start
war

they
do
not
attempt
to
hide
it

that
oblig
us
to
be
on
the
watch
to
think
of
the
protect
of
the
reich


we
know
further
that
now

as
befor

there
is
lurk
threaten
that
jewish
intern
world
enemi
who
has
found
a
live
express
in
bolshev

we
also
know
the
power
of
the
intern
press
that
live
sole
on
lie
and
calumni

in
view
of
this
peculiar
of
the
world
about
us
and
of
these
forc
we
must
be
care
about
the
futur

we
must
at
all
time
have
a
will
for
peac
but
be
readi
for
defens


i
have

therefor

decid
to
continu
construct
of
our
fortif
in
the
west
with
increas
energi
as
alreadi
indic
in
my
nuremberg
speech

also

i
shall
includ
larg
district
that
hitherto
lay
befor
our
fortif
name
the
aachen
region
and
saarbruecken
region

in
this
belt
of
fortif

that
will
be
done
for
the
protect
of
the
reich


as
for
the
rest

i
am
happi
now
to
be
abl
within
the
next
few
day
to
rescind
those
measur
that
we
have
project
or
been
compel
to
introduc
dure
critic
month
and
week

i
am
happi
hundr
of
thousand
of
men
can
go
home
and
reservist
can
be
discharg

i
am
happi
to
be
abl
to
thank
them
for
do
their
duti

i
am
particular
happi
to
be
abl
to
thank
the
german
peopl
for
have
conduct
itself
in
so
wonder
man
a
manner

especial
do
i
thank
a
hundr
thousand
german
worker

engin
and
other
of
whom
10
000
are
stand
in
your
midst


men
who
help
build
fortif

you
have
help

my
comrad

to
secur
peac
for
germani

and
so

as
a
strong
state

we
are
readi
at
all
time
to
embark
upon
a
polici
of
understand
with
the
world
about
us

we
can
do
that

we
want
noth
from
other

we
have
no
wish
or
demand

we
want
peac


there
is
onli
one
thing


this
refers
to
our
relations
to
england

it
would
be
good
if
in
england
certain
mannerisms
held
over
from
the
versailles
period
were
discarded

we
just
cannot
stand
for
a
governess
like
guardianship
of
germani


inquiri
by
british
statesmen
or
parliamentarian
concern
the
fate
of
the
reich
s
subject
insid
germani
are
out
of
order

we
do
not
bother
about
similar
thing
in
england

the
rest
of
the
world
would
sometim
have
had
reason
enough
to
bother
about
intern
happen


happen
in
palestin

we
leav
this
to
those
who
feel
themselv
pre
ordain
by
god
to
solv
these
problem

and
we
observ
with
amaz
how
they
do
solv
them

we
must

howev

give
these
gentlemen
advic
to
attend
even
more
to
the
solut
of
their
own
problem
and
to
leav
us
in
peac


it
also
is
part
of
the
task
of
secur
world
peac
that
respons
statesmen
and
politician
look
after
their
own
affair
and
refrain
from
constant
meddl
talk
with
the
problem
of
other
countri
and
peopl

by
such
mutual
consider

precondit
are
realli
creat
for
durabl
peac

of
which
no
one
is
more
earnest
desir

than
we
what
it
mean
to
be

and
be
at

for

when
six
year
ago
i
took
over
the
leadership
of
the
reich
one
of
our
so
call

statesmen

of
that
day
said


now
this
man
has
taken
the
decis
step

up
to
now
he
has
been
popular

becaus
he
has
been
in
opposit

now
he
must
govern
and
we
shall
see
in
six
or
eight
week
how
his
popular
will
look


six
year


not
six
week
onli


have
pass
and
i
believ
that
they
have
been
the
most
decis
year
for
german
histori

the
most
characterist
featur
of
this
period
is
the
close
uniti
of
the
german
peopl

what
i
have
achiev
in
these
six
year
was
possibl
onli
becaus
i
had
stand
behind
me
the
whole
german
peopl

the
problem
which
face
us
no
singl
man
could
solv
unaid

onli
when
he
could
speak
and

if
necessari

also
act
in
the
name
of
the
whole
german
peopl
could
he
master
these
question





dure
the
last
few
month
and
week
i
have
had
in
my
foreign
polici
a
great
helper
and
previous

in
my
last
speech
in
this
hall

the
sportpalast


i
express
my
thank
to
the
man
who
took
his
stand
in
support
of
germani
as
a
true

great
friend

benito
mussolini

he
has
thrown
into
the
scale
of
a
just
solut
the
entir
forc
not
onli
of
his
own
genius
but
of
the
power
which
stand
behind
him

i
must
also
thank
the
two
other
great
statesmen
who
at
the
last
minut
recogn
the
histor
hour

declar
themselv
readi
to
give
their
support
to
the
solut
of
one
of
europ
s
most
burn
problem
and
who
therebi
made
it
possibl
for
me

too

to
offer
the
hand
toward
an
understand

but
abov
all
my
thank
fli
to
the
german
peopl
which
in
these
long
month
has
never
desert
me








i
am
proud
of
my
german
peopl

i
hope
that
in
a
few
day
the
problem
of
the
sudeten
german
will
be
final
solv

by
october
10
we
shall
have
occupi
all
the
area
which
belong
to
us

thus
one
of
europ
s
most
serious
crise
will
be
end

and
all
of
us

not
onli
in
germani
but
those
far
beyond
our
frontier

will
then
in
this
year
for
the
first
time
realli
rejoic
at
the
christma
festiv

it
should
for
us
all
be
a
true
festiv
of
peac





above
us
all
stand
the
motto


no
one
in
the
world
will
help
us
if
we
do
not
help
ourselv


this
programm
of
self
help
is
a
proud
and
man
programm

it
is
a
differ
programm
from
that
of
my
predecessor
who
continu
ran
round
through
the
world

go
a
beg
now
in
versaill

then
in
geneva

now
in
lausann
or
at
some
confer
or
other
elsewher

it
is
a
prouder
thing
that
to
day
we
german
are
determin
to
solv
our
own
problem
and
to
help
ourselv








we
have
been
wit
of
a
great
turn
point
in
histori

at
this
moment
we
must
bethink
ourselv

too

of
those
who
through
twenti
year
in
an
appar
hopeless
state
still
nurs
a
fanat
faith
in
germani
and
never
surrend
their

deutschtum

their
life
as
german

it
is
so
easi
here
in
the
heart
of
the
empire
to
profess
one
s
belief
in
germani

but
it
is
inexpress
difficult

in
the
face
of
an
unceas
persecut

not
to
allow
oneself
to
be
drawn
away
from
this
faith


to
remain
fanat
true
to
it

as
though
redempt
were
come
the
next
day

but
now
the
hour
of
redempt
has
come

i
have
just
had
my
first
sight
of
these
area
and
what
move
me
so
profound
was
two
impress

first

i
have
often
known
the
jubil
and
the
enthusiasm
of
joy

but
here
for
the
first
time
i
have
seen
hundr
of
thousand
shed
tear
of
joy

and
second
i
saw
appal
distress

when
in
england
a
duff
cooper
or
a
mr

eden
say
that
injustic
has
been
done
to
the
czech

then
these
men
should
just
for
onc
see
what
in
realiti
has
happen
there

how
can
one
so
pervert
the
truth

i
have
seen
here
whole
villag
undernourish

whole
town
reduc
to
ruin

my
fellow
countrymen

you
have
a
great
debt
of
honor
to
pay







i
expect
of
you
that
the
winter
help
contribut
of
1938

with

in

peopl
the
year
1938
will
be
a
great

incompar

proud
year




later
historian
will
show
that
the
german
nation
found
it
way
back
again
to
the
posit
of
an
honour
great
nation


that
our
histori
has
onc
more
becom
a
worthi
histori

it
is
said
in
england
that
this
war

of
cours

is
not
for
poland

that
is
onli
secondari

more
import
is
the
war
against
the
regim
in
germani

and
i
receiv
the
honor
of
special
mention
as
a
repres
of
this
regim

if
that
is
now
set
up
as
a
war
aim

i
will
answer
the
gentlemen
in
london
thus


it
is
for
me
the
greatest
honor
to
be
thus
class

on
principl
i
educ
the
german
peopl
so
that
ani
regim
which
is
laud
by
our
enemi
is
poison
for
germani
and
will
therefor
be
reject
by
us

if

therefor

a
german
regim
would
get
the
consent
of
churchil

duff
cooper
and
eden
it
would
be
paid
and
kept
by
these
gentlemen
and
henc
would
be
unbear
for
germani

that

certain

is
not
true
with
us

it
is

therefor

onli
honor
for
us
to
be
reject
by
these
gentlemen

i
can
assur
these
gentlemen
onli
this

if
they
should
prais

this
would
be
a
reason
for
me
to
be
most
crestfallen

i
am
proud
to
be
attack
by
them


but
if
they
believ
they
can
therebi
alien
the
german
peopl
from
me

then
they
either
think
the
german
peopl
are
as
lack
in
charact
as
themselv
or
as
stupid
as
themselv

they
err
in
both

nation
social
did
not
educ
the
german
peopl
in
vain
dure
the
past
twenti
year

we
are
all
men
who

in
their
long
struggl

have
been
noth
but
attack

that
onli
tend
to
increas
the
love
of
our
follow
and
creat
an
insepar
union

and
as
the
nation
socialist
parti
took
upon
itself
this
year
long
struggl

final
to
win
it

thus
the
nation
socialist
reich
and
the
german
peopl
take
up
the
fight
and
those
gentlemen
may
be
convinc

by
their
ridicul
propaganda
the
german
peopl
will
not
be
undermin

those
bungler
will
have
becom
our
apprentic
for
mani
year
befor
they
can
even
attempt
propaganda


if
peopl
go
to
piec
it
will
not
be
the
german
peopl

who
are
fight
for
justic

who
have
no
war
aim
and
who
were
attack


rather

those
peopl
will
break
when
they
gradual
find
out
what
their
mislead
plan

and
gradual
grasp
for
what
littl
reason
they
are
fight

and
that
the
onli
reason
for
war
are
the
profit
or
polit
interest
of
a
veri
small
cliqu

a
part
of
it
declar
in
britain
that
this
war
will
last
three
year

then
i
can
onli
say

my
sympathi
are
with
the
french
poilu

what
he
is
fight
for
he
doe
not
know

he
know
onli
that
he
has
the
honor
to
fight
at
least
three
year

but
if
it
should
last
three
year

then
the
word
capitul
will
not
stand
at
the
end
of
the
third

and
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
year
the
word
capitul
also
will
not
be

and
not
in
the
fifth
either

and
also
not
in
the
sixth
or
seventh
year


these
gentlemen
should
take
note
of
the
follow

today
you
have
the
germani
of
frederick
the
great
befor
you

these
gentlemen
can
believ
this

the
german
peopl
will
not
split
up
in
this
fight
but
becom
more
unifi

if
anyth
split
up
it
will
be
those
state
that
are
not
so
homogen

those
empir
built
on
the
oppress
of
peopl

we
are
fight
onli
for
our
nake
be

we
are
not
abl
ourselv
to
be
misl
by
propaganda


just
imagin

there
are
peopl
who
say
there
are
those
rule
in
anoth
land
who
do
not
pleas
us

so
now
we
have
war
with
them

natur
they
do
not
carri
on
the
war
themselv

but
look
about
for
someon
to
conduct
it
for
them

they
provid
cannon
and
grenad
while
other
provid
grenadi
and
soldier

such
an
utter
lack
of
conscienc


what
would
be
said
if
one
of
us
should
say
that
the
present
regim
in
franc
or
britain
doe
not
suit
us
and
consequ
we
are
conduct
a
war

what
immeasur
lack
of
conscienc

for
that

million
of
person
are
whip
into
death

these
gentlemen
can
say
that
calm

for
they
themselv
never
have
been
on
the
battlefield
for
even
an
hour


but
we
will
see
how
long
they
keep
nation
at
war

there
can
be
no
doubt
of
one
thing

howev

we
will
take
up
the
gauntlet
and
we
will
fight
as
the
enemi
fight

england

with
lie
and
hypocrisi

alreadi
has
begun
to
fight
against
women
and
children

they
found
a
weapon
which
they
think
is
invinc

name

sea
power

and
becaus
they
cannot
be
attack
with
this
weapon
they
think
they
are
justifi
in
make
war
with
it
against
women
and
children


not
onli
of
enemi
but
also
of
neutral
if
necessari


let
them
make
no
mistak
here

howev

the
moment
could
come
veri
sudden
in
which
we
could
use
a
weapon
with
which
we
cannot
be
attack

i
hope
then
they
do
not
sudden
begin
to
think
of
human
and
of
the
imposs
of
wage
war
against
women
and
children

we
german
do
not
like
that

it
is
not
in
our
natur

in
this
campaign
i
gave
an
order
to
spare
human
be

when

it
can

that
someon

in

we

but
there
should

no

about
one
thing


england

is
not

a

a
